      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Williams's
      essays merit a few words of commendation from folk-lorists on this side of
      the Atlantic as being calculated to interest readers in a subject which is
      full of profound significance, but against which they may possibly be
      prejudiced in the degree that science claims it as material for analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      For within the last few years folk-lore has been promoted to the rank of a
      serious study and the Folk-Lore Society of London, aided by its numerous
      and lusty offshoots, both American and Continental, is busily applying the
      scientific method to fireside tale, custom, song, and ballad seeking what
      old philosophies lie at the heart of these, and what they have to tell
      about intercourse between peoples in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the folk-lorist treats his subject-matter as tenderly as
      Isaak Walton bade the angler hook his worm, for he remembers what poetry
      the song and saga hold, and that laughter and tears are ever young.
    </p>
    <p>
      These essays range over a wide field, both of space and time. The earlier
      in arrangement deal with subjects which are purely literary and modern,
      and justify their presence only in the reasons advanced by the author. But
      the major number come within the ken of the folk-lorist, and appeal not to
      him only, but to all who are moved by the passion and sincerity of
      primitive poetry, in the skill and sympathy with which the varied note of
      folk-song in East and West is interpreted. In some of the examples,
      however, notably those from Roumania, Mr. Williams does not sufficiently
      allow for the modern dress in which the peasant verse is clothed.

      AMERICAN SEA SONGS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>h, fare ye well,
      my pretty, fair maids,

    <p class="indent15">

      I'm bound for the Rio Grande!
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who is old enough to remember the glorious spectacle of a
      full-rigged American clipper ship getting under full sail outside of the
      headlands of a harbor, after having been cast off by the tug, is likely to
      have forgotten the sight: the white sails dropping from the yards, being
      sheeted home, and swelling out to the fresh wind, until a cloud of canvas
      sparkled in the sun; the strong and graceful life which the ship took on
      under their power; the foam curling up under the bow with her forward
      rush; the great plain of the ocean, with all its free airs and salt
      scents, beckoning to life and adventure seaward round the world. To this,
      to one on board or near enough to hear, will be added the indefinable and
      mysterious charm of the sailors' chants, as they haul in the bowline, and
      tauten up the tacks and sheets by a pull requiring unison of effort; and
      the cadence, at once long-drawn and vigorous, fills the air with a magic
      voice of the wind and the sea. It has the melopoeism, if it may be so
      called, of the cadence of nature, and takes its note from the solitude and
      melancholy of the world, never more impressive than upon the vast plain of
      the sea. It has been heard from immemorial time, since the first oarsmen
      pulled together along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, and possesses the
      same essence in whatever language it is uttered; and, while it has its
      practical purpose in securing unison and accentuation of effort, it would
      be a mistake to suppose it without origin in and appeal to the innate
      impulse for the expression of sentiment in melody in the heart of man.
      Every sea captain knows, or used to know, how much more quickly the anchor
      came up, or how much more hearty were the pulls on the bowlines, if there
      were a full-lunged and melodious leader for the "shanty;" and his
      practical minded mate would at times shout, when the chorus was going
      faintly and mechanically, "Sing out there, can't ye?" with the same
      purpose with which he would exhort the men to take a stronger pull.
      Conversely, a poor leader, or a second who could not or would not keep in
      proper time, was a decided injury to the effectiveness of the labor; and
      it sometimes happened that an energetic captain, when his ship was being
      got under way, would step up to a sailor, apparently heaving sturdily at
      the windlass, and knock him sprawling, for the reason that he had detected
      him giving the wrong time to the chant, out of mischief, or for the sake
      of testing the sharpness and intelligence of the "old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of these windlass and bowline "shanties" have, of course, little
      of the element of finished poetry about them. They are not songs, but
      chants, whose purpose is to give accentuation and force to the exertion of
      united strength rather than to the expression of sentiment, and of which
      the rhythmical melody is the essential element. Whether they be new or
      old, they always have been essentially improvisations, capable of being
      stopped at any moment or added to indefinitely, and, like the refrains of
      the old ballads, are dependent upon the sound rather than the sense for
      their effect. Nevertheless, however imperfect and indefinite their
      expression, they took their tone and color originally from the elements in
      which they were born, and gave out not only the voice of the sea and the
      wind, the notes of the never silent Æolian harp of the cordage and the
      bellying sails, but the prevailing sentiment of the human heart upon the
      great deep, its underlying oppression, its longing for home, its craving
      for relief from monotony; and it is a dull ear that would not detect this,
      under the most absurd and uncouth words ever strung together in a sailor's
      shanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As among the seamen of all races, the chants of the American sailors,
      before they were so reduced in quality and number by the combined
      influence of steam vessels and a protective tariff, were of ancient and
      indefinite origin, and were constantly being altered or added to by
      circumstance and improvisation. They came, of course, first from the
      English seamen, who were our sailors' ancestors and associates, to whom at
      least the element descended from the songs to which the galleys of the sea
      kings of Scandinavia were impelled over the foaming brine, or the Celtic
      coracle was paddled on the lonely lake; and it is impossible, in a mass of
      rude verse, of little definite meaning, of a fluid and fluctuating form,
      and handed down from lip to lip without ever, except incidentally, having
      been put into print and preserved, to fix the origin or the date of
      creation of any of these songs. There are traces of old phrases and
      archaisms, ancient words strangely metamorphosed into a semblance of
      modern meaning, and all such settlings and deposits as are to be found in
      the geological strata of spoken language,&mdash;references to mermaids,
      sea-serpents, and survival of myths regarding the powers of the sea and
      air; but they are of no such distinct historic value as are the
      indications to be found in the more definite folk-lore in prose or verse,
      which have the element of dramatic interest and narrative. It is to be
      remembered that these chants, as we have said, were essentially
      improvisations, with a purpose different from ordinary song,&mdash;that
      is, to give the governing power of melody to united exertion,&mdash;and
      that whatever color and substance they have are extraneous, and not
      inherent. What is distinctively American can be determined only by local
      allusions or by definite knowledge of their origin: the first are of very
      little value, for an English chant, with its local allusions, might be
      very readily altered into an American one by the substitution of American
      names; and in regard to the second, as has been said, the songs were born,
      and passed from mouth to mouth, and from ship to ship, without any one's
      knowing or caring where they originated. Nevertheless, the American
      sailors, when there were American sailors, had as strong a national and
      provincial feeling as those of any other country; were capable of making
      their own chants, if not as much given to improvisation as those of the
      Latin races; and had a selection of local names as sonorous and as readily
      adapted to the needs of a rhythmical chorus as those of any
      English-speaking people. The Rio Grande and the Shenandoah were as
      mouth-filling and sonorous as the High Barbarie or any of the refrains of
      the English shanties, and the American sailor sheeted home his canvas with
      Virginia Ashore, or Baltimore, or Down to Mobile Bay in his remembrance as
      well as on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Premising that American shanties are not American sea songs in any
      definite sense of the term, and fulfill only the conditions to which they
      are subject as aids to labor and stimulants to exertion, we may take a
      specimen or two to show what they were like. It is needless to say that
      neither the words nor a musical notation would give any idea of their
      effect when sung with full-throated chorus to sea and sky, and that their
      peculiar melodious cadence and inflection can be caught only by hearing
      them. Like the chants of the negro slaves, which they resemble in many
      respects, musical notes would give only the skeleton of the melody, which
      depends for its execution upon an element which it defies the powers of
      art to symbolize. They have various forms,&mdash;a continued and unbroken
      melody, as when turning the capstan or pumping, or they show an emphatic
      accentuation at regular intervals, as when stretching out a bowline with
      renewed pulls; and such as they are, they are given precisely as sung,
      with a dependence upon the reader's imagination to supply in some degree
      the cadence and accentuation. The following are good specimens of the
      bowline chants.

      There were many, with slight American variants, which were undoubtedly of
      English origin, and have been heard on English merchant ships from time
      immemorial; some which relate especially to the operations of whaling; and
      some which had their origin on the river flatboats and in the choruses of
      the roustabouts on the Ohio and Mississippi, and have been only slightly
      changed for salt-water purposes, the quality being as little varied as the
      number is endless. Their essential quality was that of an improvised
      chant, and the dominant feeling was to be found in the intermingling of
      the words and the cadence, as in the apparently meaningless refrain of the
      old ballads. They expressed, through all their rudeness and uncouthness,
      and more through the melody than the words, the minor chords which
      distinguish all folk music, the underlying element in the human heart
      oppressed by the magnitude and solitude of nature, as well as the
      enlivening spirit of strong exertion; and no sensitive ear could ever call
      them really gay, however vigorous and lively they might be. The shanties
      are passing away with the substitution of iron cranks and pulleys for the
      muscles of men, and the clank of machinery has taken the place of the
      melodious chorus from human throats. It is not probable that they will
      ever entirely disappear so long as men go down to the sea in ships; but
      whatever life and flavor they had will fade away, and the first-class
      leading tenor among the "shanty men" will vanish with the need and
      appreciation of his skill. As for the old words, they will also be utterly
      lost, because they have no existence except in oral recitation and memory,
      and do not contain enough of the elements of pure poetry to secure their
      preservation in print, as the folk songs and ballads have been preserved.
      They are relics of custom rather than of literature; and although any poet
      or musician who deals with the sea will miss a source of very valuable
      inspiration if he does not possess himself of the spirit of their weird
      melody and the unconscious power of their vigorous rhythm, in themselves
      they are likely to be lost with the chants of the Phoenician sailors or
      the rowers of the galley of Ulysses, which they have succeeded, and some
      of whose melody they have perhaps reproduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genuine sea songs differ from the shanties in that they had a definite
      poetical purpose to tell a story or express emotion, and were not merely
      words strung together to give voice to a rhythm of labor. It cannot be
      said that the genius of the American sailor has turned itself especially
      to expressing his emotions in song, any more than that of the English. His
      nature is entirely too practical, and the touch of tender sentiment which,
      in the Scotch nature, produced the beautiful fishing songs of the coast
      and the grand rowing and boat songs of the Western Islands, is wanting
      alike in him and his English associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would probably astonish most readers to be told that English literature
      is singularly deficient in sea songs, when they have in memory the noble
      odes of Campbell, the long list of the Tom Bowlings and Jack Junks of
      Dibdin, Cherry's Bay of Biscay and The Minute Gun at Sea, and the many
      good songs about ships and sea fights by Barry Cornwall, Cunningham, and
      many others. But these songs were not written by sailors. There never has
      been any English sailor, except the respectable William Falconer, the
      author of The Shipwreck, in several cantos of desiccated decasyllabic
      verse, who has written of the sea in verse from the standpoint of actual
      experience, or to do for it in poetry what Captain Marryat, Michael Scott,
      and W. Clark Russell have done in prose. English sea songs have been
      written by landsmen; even the charming Wapping Old Stairs is a song of the
      waterside, and not of the ocean; and as for the famous heroes of Dibdin's
      nautical songs, including Tom Bowling himself, they are very much, as
      Thackeray said, "har-lar" Mr. T. P. Cooke, the actor, who personated the
      gallant Jack Tar in a very blue jacket with very bright buttons, and very
      white duck trousers, and appealed to "England, Home, and Beauty" as
      represented in the cits of the gallery at Sadler's Wells theatre. Dibdin's
      heroes smell of stage gas rather than of tar, and their purpose and effect
      were very much more to persuade susceptible landsmen that the British navy
      was an elysium, in which beating Frenchmen was a glorious episode in an
      existence devoted mainly to passing the can between decks at sea and
      basking in the smiles of lovely Nan and faithful Poll on shore, than to
      tell what the seamen themselves really felt about it. The writers of the
      ordinary English sea songs had their lodgings in the neighborhood of Drury
      Lane rather than in the forecastle, and their inspiration was as strictly
      commercial as that of Mr. Slum, who supplied the anagrams and acrostics
      announcing the treasures in Mrs. Jarley's waxworks. Some of them are good
      in their way, as are a few of those of Dibdin and Andrew Cherry, and
      particularly The Saucy Arethusa, in which there is a real flavor of the
      sea spirit, and which was written by one Prince Hoare, a comic opera
      libretto writer of sixty years ago; the author, by the way, of Mrs.
      Micawber's favorite song, Little Tafflin with the Silken Sash. But when
      one comes to look for real forecastle songs, written by a sailor, and
      smelling of pitch and tar, one finds very few. Doubtless some have been
      lost, although there is a strong vitality to anything that is good; but
      except Kobert Kidd, Sailing down on the High Barbarie, Captain Glen, Jacky
      Tar with his Trousers on,&mdash;the immortal song which appealed to the
      feeling heart of Captain Edward Cuttle,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I know you would have me wed a farmer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And not give me my heart's delight;
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me the lad whose tarry trousers
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shine to me like diamonds bright,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mermaid, and few others, there is nothing which indicates that the
      British sailor was given to expressing himself in verse beyond the simple
      exigencies of the shanty. The case was very much the same with the
      American, and, under ordinary circumstances, it would be as vain to look
      for poetical feeling in the shrewd, practical-minded, and gritty New
      England seaman as in his more stolid and coarse-fibred English associate.
      Nevertheless, so much of the best spirit of the American people was once
      turned toward the sea for its field of action, its naval history has been
      so inspiring to national pride, and its record of adventure in all parts
      of the world has been so remarkable that it would have been impossible
      that it should not have produced some worthy or at least illustrative
      fruit in poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The era of the Revolution was not distinguished for its naval exploits,
      except the memorable raid of the Scotch adventurer, John Paul Jones, upon
      the English seas, and the fight of the Bonhomme Richard with the Serapis
      and the Countess of Scarborough, for the reason that the colonies had no
      warships, and no means of procuring any. There were, however, a few
      privateers: the Hyder Ali, commanded by Captain Barney, which won a
      victory over the British vessel General Monk, and was celebrated in verse
      by Philip Freneau, and for which he wrote a recruiting song, with at least
      one verse of a practical tendency:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Here's grog enough; come drink about.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I know your hearts are firm and stout.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      American blood will never give out,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As often we have proved it;
    </p>
    <p>
      the Fair American, commanded by Captain Daniel Hawthorne, which fought a
      British snow, laden with troops, off the coast of Portugal, and whose
      exploits are recorded in a ballad of very considerable spirit, and
      evidently by one of the crew; and some others, who did not happen to have
      a poet on board or a laureate on shore, and are not embalmed in verse. To
      this period, however, belongs what is, perhaps, the very best of American
      sea songs. We do not know whether its authorship was of that time or not,
      although it probably was, and from internal evidence would seem to have
      been composed by one of the very crew of the Ranger, Paul Jones's ship,
      which escaped from a British squadron in the Irish Channel in 1778. It was
      first published by Commodore Luce, in his collection of Naval Songs, with
      the statement that it was taken down from the recitation of a sailor. It
      is one of the gems of forecastle song, has the full scent of the brine and
      the gale, and the ship does not manouvre as if she were a wagon on dry
      land, as was said of Allan Cunningham's account of Paul Jones's cruises.

      The naval war of 1812 was a glorious epoch in American history. The
      achievements of the troops were very far from creditable, with a few
      exceptions, including, of course, the great one of the repulse of British
      regulars at New Orleans; but on the ocean the American sailors proved
      themselves quite the equal, if not more, of the English seamen, who had
      learned to consider themselves invincible, and despised the petty fleet of
      half a dozen cruisers,&mdash;not a single line-of-battle ship in the
      number,&mdash;which they had force enough to sweep off the seas without a
      struggle, and which they finally did blockade into inaction. There was
      quite an outburst of surprise, incredulity, and indignation in England,
      when the news came in that British frigates, one after another, the
      Guerriere, the Java, and the Macedonian, had been captured in singleship
      fights by American ships of the same grade, and that in contests between
      vessels of smaller size, like the Wasp and the Frolic, the Hornet and the
      Peacock, Yankee pluck and seamanship had been equally successful; and
      British naval historians, then and since, have been earnest in showing
      that the victories were due to superior weight of metal, to the presence
      of deserters from the British navy on board the American ships, and to the
      accidents of naval warfare. Nevertheless, the facts of the captures
      remained the same, and privateers ravaged the seas, plundering and burning
      English ships, and causing the most bitter annoyance as well as
      incalculable loss and damage. To the vindictive depreciation and abuse of
      the English writers the Americans were not slow to respond, with a joyous
      outburst of national pride and exultation, and a mighty flapping of the
      wings of the American eagle; and the poets and song-writers joined in the
      shrill cock-a-doodle-doo of victory. The country was a great deal more
      boastful and self-assertive than it has been since it has come to rely on
      its own strength and has known the achievement of the great and sobering
      task of the civil war. The spirit of the spread eagle pervaded our
      national literature; the poets burst into songs,&mdash;generally, it must
      be admitted, very bad,&mdash;in which they celebrated the naval victories
      of the day. They indulged in mythological flights of the highest kind, in
      which Neptune bestowed a laurel crown upon Hull, Amphitrite smiled upon
      Bainbridge and Decatur, and the Tritons and the Nereids joined in a chorus
      of love and admiration for the American sailor. America, Commerce, and
      Freedom appeared as conjoined goddesses, and everybody was summoned to
      fill the bumper and pledge the flowing bowl, to thank the mighty Jove and
      invoke Bacchus, and do all sorts of things entirely unfamiliar to a people
      whose principal intoxicating beverages were Medford rum and Monongahela
      whiskey, and who had not the slightest acquaintance with heathen gods and
      goddesses. It is needless to say that none of these songs were written by
      sailors, or were ever sung by them, even if they could have been sung by
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, better stuff than this in the naval songs of the war
      of 1812. The American sailor himself sometimes cleared his cheek of its
      quid, and sang in a clear if somewhat nasal voice some of the deeds which
      he had seen and done. Thus there is a great deal of rude vigor in one of
      the verses of a song describing the fight between the Constitution and the
      Guerriere, the first of our naval victories, and a very favorite theme:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But Jonathan kept cool,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      At the roaring of the Bull.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His heart filled with anything but fears;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And squirting out his quid,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As he saw the captain did,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He cleaned out his mouth for three cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another song on the same engagement, entitled Halifax Station, begins
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From Halifax Station a bully there came,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To take or be taken, called Dacres by name;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And who but a Yankee he met on his way;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Says the Yankee to him, "Will you stop and take tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After giving Dacres's high and mighty address to his crew, and Hull's more
      modest appeal, it says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then we off with our hats and gave him a cheer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Swore we'd stick by brave Hull, while a seaman could
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      steer.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then at it we went with a mutual delight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For to fight and to conquer is a seaman's free right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet naturally takes the privilege of presenting the confounded
      Britisher in the most humiliating light, and the manner in which Captain
      Dacres signified his surrender is probably more graphic than historically
      correct:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then Dacres looked wild, and then sheathed his sword,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When he found that his masts had all gone by the board.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And, dropping astern, cries out to his steward,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Come up and be d&mdash;&mdash;d! Fire a gun to leeward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This battle, fought in the North Atlantic on August 2, 1812, between the
      American frigate Constitution, Captain Isaac Hull, and the British frigate
      Guerriere, Captain James R. Dacres, and one of consummate seamanship as
      well as fighting capacity on the part of Hull, was the theme of the best
      and most spirited song of the whole war; one which still keeps its place
      in the forecastle, and, it may be hoped, will keep it so long as Uncle Sam
      has a war-ship afloat. It is set to a very lively and emphatic air,
      called, indifferently, The Landlady of France and The Bandy-Legged
      Officer, from the coarsely comical words which George Colman the younger
      had written to it.

      The English celebrated their one signal victory of the war&mdash;the
      capture of the Chesapeake by the Shannon, off Boston Light, a year later&mdash;by
      a parody of this song, of a decidedly inferior quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most notable events of the war was the cruise of the Essex,
      Captain David Porter, in the South Pacific, in 1813 and 1814. She did an
      immense amount of damage to the British whalemen, and the British ships
      Cherub and Phoebe were sent to capture her. After a rencontre in the
      harbor of Valparaiso, in which the captain of the Phoebe, taken at a
      disadvantage, protested his purpose to respect the neutrality of the port,
      and a challenge from which the British ships ran away, the Essex was
      caught disabled by a squall, chased into a harbor near Valparaiso, and
      captured after a tremendous engagement, in which the calibre of the
      British guns gave them every advantage, and in which the neutrality of the
      port was not taken into account. There was a poet on board the Essex, and
      he produced a long ballad describing the cruise and the retreat of the
      British ships after the challenge; but whether he perished in the later
      fight, or had no heart to add it to his verses, is not known. Among the
      crew of the Essex who did survive the fight was Midshipman David G.
      Farragut, who lived to achieve the greatest naval renown since that of
      Nelson, and be the theme of The Bay Fight, the noblest sea poem yet
      written.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ballad of the Essex is entitled "A Pleasant New Song. Chanted by
      Nathan Whiting (through his nose) for the amusement of the galley slaves
      on board the Phoebe, who are allowed to sing nothing but psalms." After
      describing the beginning of the trouble caused by "John Bull's taking our
      ships and kidnaping our true sailors," and the capture of British vessels
      in the first year of the war, the ballad takes up the cruise of the Essex.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The saucy Essex, she sailed out
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To see what she could do.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Her captain is from Yankee land,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And so are all her crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Away she sailed, so gay and trim,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Down to the Galapagos,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And toted all the terrapins,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And nabbed the slippery whalers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And where d' ye think we next did go?
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Why, down to the Marquesas.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And there we buried underground
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Some thousand golden pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then sailed about the ocean wide,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sinking, burning, taking,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Filling pockets, spilling oil,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      While Johnny's heart was aching.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The ballad then describes the arrival of the Phoebe and Cherub and the
      rencontre in Valparaiso Bay, the challenge and the flight of the Phoebe,
      in verses which have a great deal of rude vigor.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      At last John Bull quite sulky grew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And called us traitors all,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And swore he'd fight our gallant crew,
    </p>

      Paddies and Scots and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then out he went in desperate rage,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Swearing, as sure as day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He'd starve us all or dare us out
    </p>

      Of Valparaiso Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then out he sailed in gallant trim,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As if he thought to fright us,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Run up his flag and fired a gun
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To say that he would fight us.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Our cables cut, we put to sea,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And ran down on his quarter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And Johnny clapped his helm hard up,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And we went following after.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In haste to join the Cherub he
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Soon bent his scurvy way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While we returned in merry glee
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To Yalaparaiso Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      We 'll take no farther trouble,

    <p class="indent5">
      Since all the world must fairly know

      They 'll only fight us double.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Ne'er mind, my lads, let's drink and sing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "Free trade and sailors' rights."

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other exploits of American ships told in verse, among them the
      gallant repulse, by the crew of the privateer General Armstrong, Captain
      Samuel C. Reid, in the Harbor of Fayal, of the boats of three British
      men-of-war, which was the subject of a forecastle ballad, but none of this
      memorial verse reached the level of poetry. The battles of Lake Erie and
      Lake Champlain also had their numerous laureates; and the raid of Admiral
      Cockburn and the troops upon Baltimore was the subject of a song, the
      opening lines of which have a vigor and strong rhythm not maintained
      throughout.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Old Ross, Cochrane, and Cockburn too,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And many a bloody villain more,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Swore with their bloody, savage crew
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That they would plunder Baltimore.

      The naval service during the civil war did not produce any songs that
      achieved popularity in comparison with that won by the songs of land
      service, like John Brown's Body, The Year of Jubilo, and Marching through
      Georgia, and in fact was singularly deficient in poetry, with the
      remarkable exception of the productions of Mr. Henry Howard Brownell.
      There were few singleship engagements except the fight between the Monitor
      and the Merrimac, and the Kearsarge and the Alabama, and the blockading
      service was not calculated to inspire the martial muse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two great naval achievements of the war were the capture of New
      Orleans and of the forts in Mobile Bay by the fleets under Farragut; and
      these were celebrated in poetry worthy of them&mdash;and no more can be
      said&mdash;by Henry Howard Brownell, who witnessed the second from the
      deck of Admiral Farragut's flagship. The fire, spirit, and grand fighting
      <i>elan</i> of The Bay Fight have never been surpassed in English poetry,
      and the accuracy of its pictures is as notable as their vigor. But these
      are poems, and not songs, and there is nothing in the naval songs of the
      civil war which will compare with those of the war of 1812. It was rather
      past the time for the genuine forecastle ballad, and none of the land
      poets hit the true vein, as Buchanan Read, Stedman, and others did when
      commemorating military exploits.

      There was one other field of American seamanship, full of romance and
      excitement, which should have produced some worthy poetry and song, and
      that was the whaling service before the days of iron steamers and bomb
      lances. The chase of the gigantic cetacean in the lonely solitude of the
      Arctic and Indian oceans, the fights in frail boats with the maddened
      monster and all the perils of sea and storm, the visits to the palmy
      islands in the Southern Sea and the frozen solitude of the Arctic, were
      full of the materials of poetry. The long watches of the monotonous
      cruising during the four years' voyage gave plenty of time for any
      occupation, whether it was carving whales' teeth or making verses; and
      there were many bright spirits, attracted by the adventure of whaling, who
      could have made a literary use of their opportunity. The novels of Herman
      Melville, some of the strongest and most original in our literature, have
      given the romance of the South Sea islands as they appeared to the
      adventurer of that day; and in Moby Dick, or The White Whale, he has shown
      both the prose and the poetry of a whaling cruise with singular power,
      although with some touch of extravagance at the end. The whaling songs
      are, however, not very abundant, nor, it must be confessed, of a high
      standard of quality. To this there is one remarkable exception, which
      appears to be wholly unknown in American literature, although it has been
      in print. It is entitled a "Brand Fire New Whaling Song Right from the
      Pacific Ocean. Tune, Maggy Lander. By a Foremast Hand," and was printed in
      a little five-cent pamphlet, by E. B. Miller, in New Bedford, in 1831. It
      does not seem to have come under the eye of any critic who could
      appreciate its spirit and faithfulness, and no mention is made of it in
      any of the collections of American poetry. It is extremely doubtful if the
      author received enough from its sale to repay him for the investment of a
      portion of his "lay" in printing it, and his name is utterly lost in his
      modest pseudonym of "Foremast Hand;" so that he obtained neither fame nor
      fortune from his epic. The poem, which is too long for entire quotation,
      was unquestionably the work of a sailor on a whaling ship, and probably,
      as he says, of a foremast hand. It lacks some of the finish of
      professional literature, as shown in the ruggedness of some of its rhymes,
      and the vigorous compulsion of the rules of grammar and syntax, when
      necessary, although the author was evidently of higher education than
      would belong to one in his position, and its jigging measure becomes
      tiresome; but it is of very great spirit and vigor, as well as fidelity to
      its theme, and by no means deserves to have fallen so entirely into
      oblivion. Indeed, it seems to me to be quite as good as, and a great deal
      more original than, any American poetry which had appeared up to that
      time. The song has for its subject the chase and capture of a whale in the
      North Pacific, and relates the course of events from the time of the first
      sighting of "white water" on the horizon by the lookouts to that when the
      monster, stabbed to death by the keen lances, rolls "fins out" in the
      bloody water, amid the hurrahs of the excited boats' crews. All the
      details of this <i>grande chasse</i> are given with wonderful vigor, as
      well as faithfulness, and the historian of the whale fishery will find it
      as accurate as a log-book. Perhaps the account of the chase by the boats
      and the harpooning will give as good an idea of the force and spirit of
      the poem as any part of it; and, in reference to the emphasis of the
      language, it may be remembered that mates of whaling ships in pursuit of
      an eight-hundred-barrel whale had a good deal of energy and excitement to
      relieve. The boats have been lowered, and are darting toward the
      unsuspecting whale with all the speed of ashen oars and vigorous muscle,
      while their commanders objurgate and stimulate the crews, as the poet
      says, "judiciously."

      The rush of the whale towing the boat, his sounding to the uttermost
      length of the line, his reappearance, the lancing, the mad dash at the
      boats, and the death flurry are all described with great vividness, but
      there is room only for the verses in which the monster comes up from his
      long dive, and obliges the poet to appeal to the enemy of sea songs, the
      steam boiler:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till from the deep, with mighty leap,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Full length the monster breaches,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So strongly sped, his scarred gray head
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      High as our topmast reaches;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And, like a rock, with startling shock,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      From mountain height descending,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Down thunders he upon the sea,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Ocean with ether blending.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And, hark! once more that lengthened roar,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As from his spout-hole gushing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His breath, long spent, now finds a vent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Like steam from boiler rushing.

    <p>
      <br />

      It does not seem that a poet who could write so vividly and forcefully as
      this ought to be without a place in American literature, even if there
      were no other interest in his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another whaling song, entitled The Coast of Peru, and undoubtedly
      the work of a forecastle poet, which is worth preserving, despite its
      homeliness, for its genuine flavor, and as a relic of the old days before
      steam whalers and bomb lances took so much of the romance out of the
      fishery.

      "Now, bend to your oars, boys,

    <p class="indent5">
      While the old man pulled up,

      It is extremely doubtful if the Dago sailors and foreign 'longshoremen,
      who now make such a large portion of the crews of the Arctic steam
      whalers, are capable of even such rude verse as this, and the poetry of
      the whale fishery is now as extinct as the glory of Nantucket and the sea
      flavor of New Bedford. Like some greater things it may be regretted, but
      cannot be recovered.

    <h2>
      FOLK-SONGS OF THE CIVIL WAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of collections and criticisms of the songs and poetry of the civil war in
      this country there is no lack. Newspaper files and popular song-books have
      been ransacked, as well as more pretentious volumes, and whatever
      possessed a modicum of what is termed "poetic merit" has been gathered
      with pious care. The standard in most cases has, naturally enough, been
      that of "polite literature," that of which the writers were persons of
      education, and who endeavored to express with more or less force a
      dominant sentiment in logical as well as grammatical form, and to embody
      their meaning in intelligent words. If popular songs, which did not fulfil
      these conditions, have been included, it has usually been with an apology
      for their uncouthness, or a contemptuous reference to their banality, and
      an intimation that they were forced into the pages of the collection, or
      upon the attention of the critic, because they could not be ignored in any
      representative collection of the poetry of the war. Nevertheless, it may
      be doubted if these uncouth rhymes, without sense or consecutive meaning,
      like Dixie's Land and John Brown's Body, or the cheap sentimentality of
      Just before the Battle, Mother, and When this Cruel War is over, do not
      have something of the indefinable fascination on the printed page which
      they had to the ears of the men who sung them, and do not take a stronger
      hold upon the mind than the much more elegant and refined verses by which
      they are surrounded. Something of this may be due to the memory of those
      who heard them, and in whose minds they were the voice of the war, as the
      flags, the arms, and the uniforms were its visible insignia, but this does
      not entirely account for their fascination and permanence. There was
      something about them which endowed them with vital life, which gave them a
      hold upon every tongue and upon every heart, a quality distinct from
      obvious meaning, to say nothing of literary excellence, and which can only
      be described as the singing element. It was to accomplish this purpose, to
      relieve the heart through the lungs, without reference to the mind, to
      emphasize and lighten the buoyant or weary march, and give voice to the
      pervading impulse, which kept these songs alive and made them a practical
      part of the war, as the sailor's "shanties" were a part of the life of the
      sea, and the negro choruses of the life of the plantation. This
      fascination may fade when the civil war becomes a matter of distant
      history, and John Brown's Body be no more than a set of unmeaning jingles
      to future generations, as Lillibullero, which "sung King James out of
      three kingdoms," is to our own; but with their death will come a loss of a
      vital element of the war, as representing its living and human sentiment,
      and history will miss its function if it exclude them. How vital they were
      at the time may be seen from the fact that the attempts to supersede the
      unmeaning rhymes by words of substance and definite poetry had no effect,
      so far as their popular use was concerned, even when this was done with
      such magnificent success as in Mrs. Julia Ward Howe's Battle Hymn of the
      Republic, or General Albert Pike's powerful lines to Dixie. The people and
      the soldiers clung to the old choruses, and passed by with cold respect or
      indifference the deliberate and purely literary appeals to their feelings.
      There is, perhaps, a reason for this, which may be accounted for under the
      canons of literary criticism. A song is something different from a poem,
      and includes a dominant appeal to the ear, which may be even obstructed by
      elaborate meaning, and the simple and taking air is the essential thing.
      It is not always the case that a popular or national song is meaningless,
      as is shown in the Marseillaise and Der Wacht am Rhein; and, in our own
      war, Mr. James R. Randall's My Maryland was as popular in the Southern
      army as a song as it is vigorous and spirited as a piece of pure
      literature. But as a whole, songs which have been sung by large bodies of
      men, under stress of high excitement, have depended more upon their sound
      than their meaning for their vogue, and this would doubtless apply to the
      chants of the Crusaders as to the choruses of the Northern and Southern
      soldiers during the civil war. God save the King does not compare with Ye
      Mariners of England in any element of poetry, yet the one is always sung
      and the latter never; and Marching through Georgia depends upon its air
      rather than its commonplace words for its hold upon the martial heart.
      There was some good poetry written during the late civil war, although not
      much; and in the collections, as I have said, it is doubtful if the
      respectable verses, in which the incidents and feelings of the war were
      expressed with deliberate art, have the vitality, as they have not now the
      effect, of the rude rhymes and commonplace sentimentality of those songs
      which took hold of the hearts of the people, and were the living voices of
      the war. Too often they had the contortions of patriotism without its
      inspiration, and were forcible-feeble in appeal, or, when they attempted
      to interpret the spirit of battle, rang false to the real feeling and
      knowledge of the soldier. To this there were brilliant exceptions, like
      Mr. Gibbons's We are coming, Father Abraham, Mr. Henry Howard Brownell's
      naval poems, and Read's Sheridan's Ride, but as a whole it must be
      confessed that the polite poetry of the civil war is rather dreary
      reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an immense amount of song-writing as well as of song-singing
      during the war, and under the stress of excitement and the gathering
      together of immense bodies of young and exuberant spirits the enthusiasm
      inevitably found a vent through the lungs. The illiterate poets were as
      busy as those of higher education; and those who did not seek their public
      through the pages of the fashionable magazine, or even the poet's corner
      of the country newspaper, but through the badly printed sheet of the penny
      street ballad, or through the mouth of the negro minstrel, contributed
      almost as largely to the poetry of the war as their brothers. Dime
      song-books containing a curious admixture of the common and the polite,
      the appropriate and the incongruous, were innumerable, and the poetry
      which is below literary criticism was equal in bulk to that which is
      within its scope. Actual soldiers and sailors also sometimes wrote of
      their battles and experiences, or expressed their feelings in more or less
      finished verse, and these found their way into print either in the ballad
      sheet or the newspaper. Most of those which were good in themselves, from
      their native force and vigor or from their power as songs, have been
      preserved, but there is an immense amount of this uncollected and unedited
      verse which has a very great value as illustrating the sentiments and
      condition of the people, the waves of popular feeling during various
      phases of the war, the impressions of notable incidents and the estimates
      of prominent personages, and which tell, oftentimes more than the leading
      articles in the newspapers, how the common people were affected by the
      tremendous struggle. They have the interest, if no other, of the relics of
      arms and uniforms, and the tokens of the familiar life of a bygone age,
      and will one day be as valuable to the historian as the ballads of the
      civil war in England, which have been collected with so much care. In
      modern times and in civilized societies, the newspaper has taken the place
      of the street ballad as the record of historical events and the expression
      of political feeling, and Ireland is almost the only country where it now
      lingers in any quantity and force; but during such times of popular
      excitement, and the occurrence of great events involving the most intimate
      interests of the people, as during the civil war, the popular ballads
      resumed something of their former value as the expressions of popular
      feeling. It would be a mistake to omit from consideration even those which
      were provided as a matter of professional business by the minstrels of the
      popular stage, who reflected the pervading sentiments of the time, and
      colored their rude comedy and cheap pathos with the thoughts and feelings
      aroused by the war.
    </p>

      Thousands of these street songs were issued, to have their temporary vogue
      and disappear. The principal publisher of the penny sheets was H. de
      Marsan, 34 Chatham Street, New York, and he appears to have had almost a
      monopoly of the trade. They were printed on coarse paper, with an
      emblematic border in colors representing the American flag, and with a
      soldier and sailor under arms. Some of the more successful songs were
      copyrighted and published with their music, but this appears to have made
      little difference to the enterprising Chatham Street publisher, for he
      included almost everything that was singable, old Revolutionary ballads,
      English naval songs, and some of the more finished American poems of the
      war, as well as Ethiopian melodies, and ballads obviously of original
      contribution. It would be interesting to know whether he kept a staff of
      poets, like Jemmy Catnach of Seven Dials, or whether, as is most probable,
      he simply took what he could find, and conferred the honors of print,
      without remuneration, upon voluntary contributors. The most numerous
      contributors who bear the stamp of originality naturally came from the
      Irish element in New York, who were familiar with the street ballad at
      home, and reproduced its form and sentiment for a similar audience. There
      are dozens of ballads relating to the exploits of the Sixty-Ninth
      Regiment, an Irish organization in the New York State Guard, of which
      Michael Corcoran, an ex-member of the Irish constabulary, was colonel, and
      Thomas Francis Meagher, the Irish revolutionist, and afterward a
      brigadier-general of volunteers, a captain. The regiment took part in the
      battle of Bull Run, during which Colonel Corcoran was taken prisoner and
      carried South. The bards were instantly inspired to sing the praises of
      the regiment and its commander, and ballads were written exactly
      reproducing the style and language of the Irish "Come, all yez," as thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Come, all ye Gallant Heroes, along with me combine;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I 'll sing to you a ditty about the Glorious Sixty-Ninth.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They are a band of Brothers, from Ireland they came;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They had a bold Commander, Michael Corcoran was his
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In one or two of them there is an improvement on this very primitive
      verse, gleams of humor and ebullitions of vigorous spirit. A song entitled
      The Jolly Sixty-Ninth has a rollicking rhythm and rude humor, of which the
      following is a specimen:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      It happened one fine day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Down by the rajin say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Quite convenient to the boilin' Gulf of Mexico,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That some chaps hauled down our flag,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And it through the dust did drag,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Swearin' it should never float on Fort Sumpter, O.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of a song entitled Freedom's Guide had a force and vigor which,
      with a little more polish and form, would have entitled him to a place in
      polite literature, and the real singable quality, which was, perhaps, of
      more importance:&mdash;

      An organization almost equally popular with the New York ballad singers,
      in the early days of the war, was the "Fire Zouaves," recruited among the
      firemen of the metropolis, and which was expected to perform wonderful
      feats of daring and energy, from the character of its material. Its
      leader, Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, was killed by the landlord of a hotel
      in Alexandria, Va., while hauling down the rebel flag from the roof, and
      his death created a deep sensation from its dramatic character, and from
      the fact that it was among the earliest in the war. The elegies upon his
      death were numerous, as well as those in praise of the regiment itself.
      One of the latter, by Archibald Scott, whose name, contrary to the usual
      custom, was prefixed to the ballad, had a good deal of rude vigor, of
      which the following is a specimen:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shall ugly plugs of Baltimore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Who come out with stones and staves,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Get leave our patriots' blood to pour,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And drive our soldiers from their shore?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      No, no! by Hell, in flames shall roar
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Their city first by York Zouaves!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another phase of life in the cities, from that of the enthusiasm of the
      young men in marching to the war and the fervent appeals for enlistment,
      was that of the feelings of the women whose sons and husbands left their
      workshops to join the army. The grief was as bitter and the patriotism as
      sincere among the inmates of the crowded tenement houses and the narrow
      and barren homes of the families of the workingmen of New York as among
      their sisters in the farmhouses in the country, whose surroundings better
      lent themselves to the illumination of poetry, and it cost as much to put
      down the tin pail of the city laborer as for the farmer to
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Lay down the axe, fling by the spade,
    </p>
    <p>
      and even more in pinching poverty and lack of resource. But the griefs and
      sacrifices of these women of the city tenement and noisome alley have
      found no place in the genteel poetry of the war, and have only been
      expressed in the rude verse of the street ballad. Says one of them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It was in the month of April,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As I walked out one day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I met a woman weeping
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As I walked down Broadway.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She was weeping for her Johnny,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Her dear and only son,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Who joined the Northern army
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To fight in Washington.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O Johnny! I gave you a schoolin',
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I gave you a trade likewise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And when you joined the Volunteers,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      You know't was my advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The New York ballad writers were not entirely confined to the English
      language, the large foreign population furnishing recruits of all nations.
      There is not, so far as I have seen, any original German song devoted to
      the Union cause, but The Red, White, and Blue, and other patriotic songs,
      were published in German text; and of Germanized English songs, most if
      not all the product of variety theatre performers, there were a great
      many, including the extremely popular I'm going to fight mit Siegel.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Ven I comes from de Deutsche Countree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I vorks somedimes at baking.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Den I keeps a lager bier saloon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And den I goes shoemaking.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But now I vas a sojer man
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To save the Yankee eagle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To Schlauch dem dam Southern folks,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I'm going to fight mit Siegel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was no more representative of German sentiments than the
      "Whack-row-de-dow" Pats of the stage were of the Irish; and the German
      soldiers, when they sang in the vernacular, enlivened their foreign
      patriotism with the songs of the Fatherland. There was at least one French
      poet who appealed to his countrymen in their own language to rally to the
      cause of the Union. His production was as follows:&mdash;

      As the war dragged its slow length along, demanding greater and greater
      sacrifices, and with its days of repulse and defeat for the Union armies,
      the feeling of universal enthusiasm gave way to discouragement, and there
      were not wanting in New York, among its heterogeneous population, elements
      of bitterness which culminated in the deadly and shameful outbreak of the
      draft riots. This feeling manifested itself in the street ballads, not so
      conspicuously as the previous enthusiasm, but enough to have attracted the
      attention of those who were watching the signs of popular feeling.
      "Copperheadism" had its bards as well as loyalty, although they were much
      fewer in number, and they cannot be omitted in an account of the folksongs
      of the civil war. A rude jingle entitled Johnny, fill up the Bowl, gave
      the popular expression to this feeling:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Abram Lincoln, what yer 'bout?
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Hurrah, hurrah.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Stop this war, for it's played out,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Hurrah, hurrah.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Abram Lincoln, what yer 'bout?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Stop this war, for it's played out.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

      Johnny fill up the bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The pages of the dime song-books at this time contained a number of songs
      in opposition to the draft, expressing hatred to the negro, and a demand
      for the stoppage of the war, of which the following is an example:&mdash;

      The songs written by the soldiers and sailors themselves, descriptive of
      their engagements, or incidents of camp and march, or expressing their
      feelings, were not many, either in folk-ballads or finished poetry. Major
      J. W. De Forrest's powerful verses, In Louisiana, are almost the only
      specimen of the latter, and there are but few of the ruder ballads. It may
      have been because the soldiers and sailors were too much occupied, and
      that the life in camp and on shipboard was not favorable to poetical
      reverie, although there were many hours on picket or watch which might
      have been thus employed; but the fact remains that there was more carving
      of bone rings than of verses, and more singing than writing in the army
      and navy. There was not an absolute dearth, however, and the soldiers and
      sailors sometimes told their own stories or expressed their own feelings
      in verse. One of the best of these was written during the early days of
      the war by H. Millard, a member of Company A, Seventy-first Regiment,
      concerning the march from Annapolis to the Junction, and has the genuine
      flavor of soldiership as well as a fine spirit of <i>camaraderie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is entitled Only Nine Miles to the Junction:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The Rhode Island boys were posted along
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      On the road from Annapolis station,

      Went on in defense of the nation.

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They gave us hot coffee, a grasp of the hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Which cheered and refreshed our exhaustion;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We reached in six hours the long-promised land,

      There were not many attempts to describe the battles in which the soldiers
      took part, and they were left to the poets, who did not see them, and had
      to depend, not very successfully, upon their imagination. There was,
      however, a ballad of the Seven Days' Fight before Richmond, evidently
      written by a soldier, and of some force and vigor. It begins: &mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Away down in old Yirginny many months ago,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      McClellan made a movement and made it very slow.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The Rebel Generals found it out and pitched into our rear;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They caught the very devil, for they found old Kearney
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In the old Yirginny low-lands, low-lands,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The old Yirginny low-lands, low.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The bard details the fights as though they were a succession of Union
      victories, and concludes with a defense of General McClellan:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Now all you politicians, a word I have for you,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Just let our little Mac alone, for he is tried and true;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For you have found out lately that he is our only hope,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For twice he saved the Capitol, likewise McDowell and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiasm aroused by General McClellan among the rank and file of the
      Army of the Potomac had no counterpart in regard to any other commander,
      was proof against failure and defeat, and lingered, to a certain extent,
      even to the close of the war. His removal caused a great deal of
      indignation, and called out a good many protests and appeals for his
      restoration. A song, Give us back our old Commander, was a good deal sung
      at the time:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Give us back our old Commander,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Little Mac, the people's pride;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Let the army and the nation
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In their choice be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With McClellan as our leader,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Let us strike the blow anew;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Give us back our old Commander,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He will see the battle through.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Give us back our old Commander,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
      him manage, let him plan;

      The very rollicking and nonsensical chorus of Bummers, come and meet Us,
      belongs to this period, and was almost as popular as John Brown's Body,
      fulfilling amply and simply the conditions for relieving the lungs. Like
      the sailors' "shanties" and the plantation choruses, it was capable of
      indefinite extension and improvisation. The following is a specimen of its
      construction:&mdash;

      A seaman on board the Vandalia, one of the ships engaged in the capture of

      Some of the disagreeable features of a soldier's duty and camp life were
      dealt with by the soldiers in the spirit of humorous exaggeration, which
      was as much an evidence of high spirits as the enthusiastic choruses. A
      camp poet thus relieves his feelings in regard to the exercise of "double

      The Southern poetry of the civil war was even more rhetorical and stilted
      than that of the North. Its literary culture was more provincial, and its
      style a great deal more inflated and artificial. It was the "foemen" that
      they were to meet instead of the enemy, and "gore" instead of blood that
      was to be shed; and there was a great deal about the "clank of the
      tyrant's chain," and the "bloodstained sword," and such other fuliginous
      figures of speech. Sometimes there was a good deal of force behind this
      sounding rhetoric, as in Henry Timrod's A Call to Arms and in James R.
      Randall's There's Life in the Old Land yet, but for the most part it had
      an air of bombast and turgidity, which would have given a false impression
      in regard to the real spirit of determination among the Southern people,
      if one had only judged by its inflated expression. The pages of the
      Southern Amaranth, and other collections of rebel poetry, give the
      impression of having been written by school-boys, and contain little but
      sophomoric rhetoric of the most sounding and inflated description. That it
      had a fiery energy and an invincible determination behind it was
      abundantly shown, but the voice of the South in its polite literature was
      one of inflated extravagance. Nevertheless it produced the most manly and
      vigorous song of the whole war in Dr. J. W. Palmer's Stonewall Jackson's
      Way; and some verses appeared in a Richmond paper in 1861, entitled Call
      All, which have a fiery energy and directness unsurpassed, and were in the
      genuine language of the people:

      The street ballad did not exist in the South, so far as I can discover,
      and the popular song-books were very few in comparison with those of the
      North. There were some, however, printed on discolored paper and with
      worn-out type. Among them were The New Confederate Flag Songster, S. C.
      Griggs, Mobile; The General Lee Songster, John C. Schreiner &amp; Son,
      Macon and Savannah; The Jack Morgan Songster, compiled by a captain in
      General Lee's army; and Songs of Love and Liberty, compiled by a North
      Carolina lady, Raleigh, 1864. Like the Northern song-books, they contained
      an admixture of the popular negro melodies with the songs of the war, and
      there are but few instances of any genuine and native expression. The song
      which gave the title to The Jack Morgan Songster, however, has a good deal
      of force and vigor, and was evidently written by the camp fire. It is
      entitled Three Cheers for our Jack Morgan:&mdash;

      The tone of the Southern songs was not only a good deal more ferocious and
      savage than that of those of the North, but there were fewer indications
      of that spirit of humor which pervaded the Northern camps, and found
      expression in the soldiers' songs. There is, however, one Southern piece
      of verse, descriptive of the emotions of the newly drafted conscript,
      which has an original flavor of comicality, although evidently inspired by
      the spirit of Yankee Doodle:&mdash;

      The spirit of the Southern women is well known to have been as vigorous
      and determined as that of their brothers, and the sacrifices which they
      were compelled to make were much more severe and general than at the
      North. They had been dependent upon the North and foreign countries for
      clothing and the luxuries of the household, and when these sources of
      supply were cut off by the war and the blockade, they had to make and sew
      their own homespun dresses, and forego all the delights of fashion and
      adornment. The sacrifices and devotion of the daughters of the South were
      sung in turgid rhetoric, like the threats and appeals of the men, but here
      is a genuine voice, evidently a woman's own, which speaks for her sisters
      in their homelier trials, as well as in their deeper emotions:&mdash;

    <p>
      The folk-songs of the civil war, in which millions were engaged and which
      lasted for four years, do not compare in quality with those which much
      lighter struggles have produced, notably the Jacobite rebellion in
      Scotland. The Americans were not a singing people in the bent of their
      genius, and the conditions of life and civilization were not favorable to
      this form of expression. The newspaper had taken the place of the ballad
      as a means of influencing the public mind, and poetry had passed from the
      people to the literary artists. So when the great crisis of the civil war
      came, affecting all minds and all hearts, the people were unfamiliar with
      this mode of expression, and the literary artists had not the power to
      interpret their feelings except in their own artificial forms without
      touching the heart or giving vital meaning to the voice. The accident of
      the combination of genius with this sincerity, which produced La
      Marseillaise and Der Wacht am Rhein, did not occur, so that the great
      struggle is without an equally great song embodying and interpreting the
      spirit of the nation, and whatever fine poems and songs there were
      distinctly fall below this ideal. But in such a struggle the voice of the
      people could not fail to find expression by the means which the history of
      mankind has shown to be the most natural expression of emotion and
      enthusiasm, and their songs, however imperfect, either as literature or
      popular poetry, are the most genuine expression of the feelings and
      thoughts which filled their hearts and minds, and have a genuineness which
      informs the rude or inadequate words, and are a most important
      illustration of the history of that tremendous conflict.

    <h2>
      ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH POPULAR BALLADS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>rofessor Francis
      James Child's edition of the English and Scottish Popular Ballads,
      monumental in size, is still more monumental in the labor which it
      represents. It embodies not only diligent research for the most authentic
      and original versions of the ancient ballads in all the known sources in
      print or in manuscript, and the recovery of many from still living
      traditions in Great Britain and the United States, but a careful study and
      comparison of the folk-song of kindred European nations and of the world
      for resemblances in subject and story; thus making a most interesting and
      valuable addition to the knowledge of the common development of the human
      intellect in primitive thought and form of expression in diverse
      countries. How much study this has involved can only be appreciated by
      those who have seen its results in the concise introductions to each
      ballad, citing comparisons in every known literature, and yet further work
      in this direction will be left for later scholars, as the study and
      collection of folk-song is being pursued with more and more zeal and
      success in every quarter of the world, under the appreciation of its great
      literary as well as historical value. Professor Child has been governed by
      the strictest conscientiousness in giving his version of the popular
      ballads, not only going to the original sources like the Percy folio, the
      manuscript materials for The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border preserved
      at Abbotsford, Motherwell's note books, and other manuscripts and stall
      copies, but reprinting them with all their omissions and defects, not
      supplying the most obvious missing word or even letter without indicating
      it. He has not followed the example of the strictly faithful editors of
      the ancient ballads like Motherwell in presenting alone the most complete
      and perfect specimen, nor allowed himself like others, substantially
      faithful, like Scott and Jamieson, to collate a number of copies derived
      from different sources into a harmonious whole,-but gives each version
      distinct in itself, even to a solitary variant verse. It is one of the
      commonplaces of the history of English and Scottish ballad poetry that
      most of its collectors and editors from Bishop Percy downward have felt
      themselves entitled to amend and correct the imperfect fragments to a
      greater or less degree, supplying missing lines or stanzas to connect or
      complete the story, and that this has resulted sometimes in the most
      incongruous patchwork in which the sentiments and poetical fashions of one
      generation have been foisted upon those of another to the utter
      destruction of all verisimilitude, to say nothing of strength and
      genuineness of expression. Bishop Percy, with all his fine taste and
      genuine poetic power, was a conspicuous sinner in this respect, and
      patched the rough and strong frieze of the ancient ballads with pieces of
      the thin and sleazy silk of eighteenth century sentiment and diction. Even
      Scott, with all his sense of honesty and appreciation of the value of the
      integrity of the ancient ballads, could not always refrain from his
      possessing temptation "to give a hat and stick" to the stories which he
      heard, and, as Professor Child points out, there are some stanzas in the
      Border Minstrelsy which bear suspiciously his mark, and of which the
      originals have not been found in his manuscript materials. It is true
      enough that Scott's additions and emendations, as well as those of Allan
      Cunningham, who was wholly indifferent to the genuineness and integrity of
      his originals, were likely to be in the very spirit and turn of expression
      of the ancient ballads, and that the lover of poetry for its own sake will
      not be likely to find fault with them, but the real student of folk-song
      must repudiate them, and can be content only with the genuine expressions
      of the people, as they lived in tradition, however inchoate and imperfect
      they may he. The historical and ethnological value of the ancient ballads
      consists in their absolute genuineness, and even the imperfection of their
      utterances illustrates the condition of the popular mind and the
      characteristics of the individual intelligence which produced them, and
      are important geological evidences of the growth and development of the
      human intellect. At the same time this very imperfection of speech, and
      the struggle of primitive thought to express itself in language sometimes
      creates, as it were by accident, the very flower of strength and vividness
      in picturesque description, and the interpretation of emotion as the most
      skillful art has been unable to do. How strong these ballads were, and
      what a hold they had upon the minds and imaginations of the people, as the
      interpretation of their innate poetic spirit, is shown in the tenacity
      with which they have lived, and been reproduced in varying forms through
      generations down to the present day. Ballads like The Cruel Sister and
      Lord Thomas and Fair Annet, the production probably of the sixteenth or
      seventeenth century, have been recovered, with the essential burden of
      their verse and the subject of their story, from the mouths of English
      peasants and Irish servant girls, and in the folk-lore of the American
      nursery, to which they had been transmitted simply by the force of oral
      tradition, and without any assistance from print; and it is not likely
      that they will entirely disappear for generations to come, any more than
      the perennial nursery tales which were created by and appeal to the
      primitive and childish imagination. These traditional versions have been
      altered to suit the localities, and weakened in their coherence and vigor
      of expression from the time when they were the literature of the main body
      of the people instead of the lowest class, as the stall copies of the
      ballads of the ancient minstrels, when they were the attendants of kings
      and nobles and shared the inspiration of chivalry, have been degraded to
      the level of the intelligence of the audience of the street singers or the
      gatherings in the taprooms of the village alehouses; but they retain the
      essential characteristics of simple emotion, inherent melody, and
      primitive language, and have still something of the fine and penetrating
      flavor of popular romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is almost needless to say to the student of literature that the art of
      popular ballad writing is extinct, or is successful only in the rarest
      instances. Poets of genuine power and inspiration, imbued and saturated
      with the spirit of the ancient ballads, have attempted to re-create them
      in the telling of an ancient or modern story, but, whatever their original
      power or imitative skill, they have failed to reproduce that native
      strength and peculiar flavor of expression which gives the ancient ballads
      such a hold upon the mind. The modern ballads are admired by the intellect
      rather than felt by the heart, and are recognized as the product of
      skillful art rather than as the expression of original emotion. Even
      Scott, whose literary genius was so saturated with their spirit, and
      Wordsworth, who sought his inspiration in the simple emotions of the
      peasant heart and interpreted them so perfectly in a literary form of
      glowing simplicity, could not produce a popular ballad, and even
      Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, with all its powerful and naked mystery and
      natural archaism of thought and language, appeals to the literary rather
      than to the popular imagination. All the more absolute imitations of
      ancient literature, like those of Rossetti and Morris, have still more the
      air of unreality, in spite of what is oftentimes their very great power
      and skill, and Sir Samuel Ferguson's Lays of the Western Gael, perfect as
      they are in the reproduction of the Celtic spirit and expression, are for
      the admiration of scholars rather than the feeling of the people. It is
      hardly too much to say that in modern English literature there are but two
      poems which fulfill the conditions of the ancient ballads in their
      simplicity, directness, and originality of language, their power upon the
      mind and heart through the ear, and the indefinable flavor of primitive
      emotion, and those very different in style, subject, and form of
      expression. These are Cowper's Loss of the Royal George, and Rudyard
      Kipling's Danny Deever. Every one who has heard it or read it can repeat,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Toll for the brave,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The brave that are no more,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Sunk beneath the wave
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Fast by their native shore;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and the burden and the measure, the simplicity and strength of diction, of
      Danny Deever are equally calculated to take a possessing hold upon the
      ear. These ballads are not imitations derived from study of the ancient
      popular ballads, but obtaining their inspiration from the same original
      source in strong and primitive emotion interpreted in the simplest
      language possible, and speaking through the ear by the chanted rather than
      through the eye by the printed line. It is this appeal to the ear which is
      the strongest characteristic of the form of the ancient ballads. They were
      made to be sung or chanted rather than read, and therefore they have a
      felicity of sound as an interpreter of meaning which is often perfect in
      its expression; and when imperfect, that is, when the meaning is not
      clear, but is only vaguely and dimly attached to the sound, as in the
      refrains and burdens, there is a flavor or an atmosphere of meaning which
      pervades it and adds to the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a touch of the plaintiveness of natural sounds which no literary
      art could give in the opening of The Queen of Elphan's Nourrice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I heard a cow low, a bonnie cow low,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      An' a cow low down in yon fauld.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Long, long will my young son greet
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Or his mother take him from cauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when the burden is still more arbitrary, and without any direct
      reflection of the meaning whatever, it is never felt to be incongruous or
      artificial, and has a mystic and intensifying effect, as in the painful
      ballad of The Sheath and Knife:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He has made a grave that was long and deep,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The broom blooms bonnie, and says it is fair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he's buried his sister, with her babe at her feet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And they 'll never gang down to the broom any mair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And even when the refrain might be called simply a meaningless chant, it
      makes a part of the ballad which could not be taken away without a loss of
      the quality which gives it a living voice, as in the chorus, which sings
      of itself to The Elfin Knight:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My plaid awa, my plaid awa,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And o'er the hills and far awa,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And far awa to Norowa.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      My plaid shall not be blawn awa.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to these stanzas and lines, which give a perfect marriage of sound and
      meaning either in the interpretation of emotion or description, and in
      which the ear is the interpreter of the eye and the heart with a skill
      which no art could give, they are numberless, and of the very substance of
      the genius of the old ballad singers. There is nothing in the cultivated
      skill of trochee and spondee to equal such untaught perfections of the
      human voice as these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

    <p>
      The element of poetry of the highest kind in these ballads is the strength
      as well as the simplicity of passion interpreted in language of naked
      directness and dramatic power. Their stories are mainly those of the
      bloody tragedies and the violent events and emotions in the lives of a
      people to whom strife and adventure were an integral part of existence,
      and whose passions were strong and vigorous, although a proportion of the
      ballads have an element of rustic humor, and the cycle of those relating
      to Robin Hood is mainly of this kind. There is an element of the
      supernatural in the English and Scottish ballads, more particularly in the
      latter, which, if not so marked and pervading as in those of the Celtic
      nations, shows that the mysterious terrors of nature were still embodied
      in the visible forms of the imagination, and that the woods were still
      haunted by elfin knights, the green braes by fairies, while human beings
      were still liable to be transformed into laidly worms and foul toads by
      the enchantment of witches, in at least a pervading shadow of popular
      belief. But for the most part they were singularly free from the tincture
      of the marvelous, and mainly the simple chronicles of stirring events or
      the tragedies of passion. This gives them an element of strength, which is
      wanting to the phantasmagorial figures of more imaginative nations,
      whatever glow of misty glory shines about them as in the creations of the
      early Celtic bards. The impression of the soul of nature is strong but not
      overpowering as in these latter, and the influence of the landscape and
      the sky in storm or calm illuminates but does not interfere with the
      dramatic action. As has been said, strength of thought and strength of
      language are their prevailing characteristics. Their strength of language
      is that which belongs to the speech of a people when it is fresh and new,
      and before it has been overlaid with words created for literary purposes
      and by the introduction of foreign words to give niceties of meaning, and
      no cultivated language has the same power and directness as that which is
      the simple expression of the thoughts of the people. Goethe, with his
      sound critical insight, noted this when he said, "The unsophisticated man
      is the more master of direct, effective expression than he who has had a
      regular training," and a language may often lose in strength what it gains
      in ornament and flexibility. This strength of expression is written large
      over all the English and Scottish ballads, and specimens are merely
      arbitrary and may be taken almost at random:&mdash;

      The look cast over the shoulder is a very fa-miliar action in the ballads,
      as is also that where an angry man strikes the table with his hand and
      "keps" it with his knee. Every one who receives the letter is described as
      first smiling and then having his eyes filled with tears, as in Sir
      Patrick Spence, and almost in an exact repetition of the language, and
      there are numerous actions and phases which are the common stock of the
      ballad poets. The idea of the exclusive rights to poetical property and of
      the sin of plagiarism does not seem to have occurred to them, and they
      took a striking image or an effective phrase wherever they found it as a
      part of the common stock of poetry. These familiar and striking phrases
      doubt-less added to the effect, being recognized as old friends by the
      audience, and, like the repetitions of words and action by a number of
      persons in the same ballad, such as by the members of a family in
      succession denying the prayer of an unfortunate, emphasizing and deepening
      the impression. Certain adjectives also became attached to words as a part
      of their property, such as red to gold and wan to water, and are essential
      parts of the ballad language, which add to its effect by constant
      repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the charms of these ancient ballads is the appreciation of the
      effects of nature, given sometimes with a magical effect of suddenness and
      originality. What can be more effective, for instance, than the touch of
      beauty and charm in the tragedy of Babylon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He's killed the maid and he's laid her by
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To bear the red rose company.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And can we not feel the magic of the note of elfin horn, touching the
      heart with irresistible call through the summer air, in the opening to
      Hind Etin?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Lady Margaret sits at her bower door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sewing her silken seam;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She heard a note in Elmond wood,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And wished she there had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the unseen sea gives a note of deep solemnity and terror to
      the supernatural landscape through which Thomas, the Rhymer, journeys with
      the elfin queen:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And they rode on and farther on,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And they waded the river above the knee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And they saw neither sun nor moon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But they heard the roaring of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How the strength of a lover's thought is illuminated by the touch of
      nature itself in Willie and Alison:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When he was in his saddle set,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And slowly ridin' on his way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He had more mind o' Alison
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Than he had o' the light o' day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These touches of the power of nature upon human action, and revealing
      human thought, are scattered throughout the ballads, and have the effect
      of perfect naturalness and simplicity, as though the heart and not the
      mind spoke in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A specimen of the ancient ballad in its most perfect strength, absolute
      and concise in its construction, without wandering into irrelevancies and
      incongruities, as many of them do, and in which the appalling tragedy
      strikes with a sudden blow upon the heart at its close, is Edward. It has
      all the characteristic features of the ballads, in the vivid colors of
      nature illuminating and intensifying his dramatic dialogue, while it has
      the mist of blood in the witchlike questions of its opening, and the
      passion of hatred and despair in its close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ballads of similar form and subject are to be found in Scandinavian
      literature, and counterparts to its methods of revelation in various
      English and Scottish ballads, but none have so pure a construction and so
      perfect an effect as this:&mdash;

      Edward was communicated to Bishop Percy from Scotland by Lord Hailes, and
      there is some affectation in the ancient spelling, but it is undoubtedly
      genuine, and, as Professor Child remarks, "as spelling will not make an
      old ballad, so it will not unmake one."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most famous and best known of the ancient Scottish ballads is
      that entitled Waly, Waly, gin Love be Bony, or, as it is sometimes called,
      Lady Anne Bothwell's Lament, which was first published in Ramsay's Tea
      Table Miscellany. It has numerous variants embodying the language of the
      lament in stories of a more dramatic character, founded on a tradition of
      the Douglas family, but this has the strength and simplicity of an
      original:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O, waly, waly, up the bank,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And waly, waly, down the brae;

    <p class="indent10">

      The burden of this lament, its simple passion appealing to the popular
      heart and its melody holding the ear, has been perpetuated through the
      generations since it was first sung. It has been printed in all forms and
      variations in the broadsides and penny song books, as well as in the
      critical collections of poetry, solaced the sentimental feeling of the
      dairy maid as well as haunted the vision of Charles Lamb, and its refrain
      may be heard to-day in the burlesque choruses of the negro minstrel stage.
      A very interesting example is given by Professor Child of the way in which
      an old ballad of perfect form and construction may be made incoherent and
      shapeless in a broadside copy, mere matter of "silly sooth" for old age or
      primitive ignorance, without losing the fine flower of pathos and feeling,
      or the grace of expression, in its disconnected and ejaculatory stanzas.
      It is also interesting as an example, of which many others could be given,
      of the effect of oral tradition passing from minds of native strength, if
      without education, down to and through those of a lower order of
      intelligence, from whom now only the debris of the ancient songs and
      ballads can be obtained.

      It is from a broadside printed in Edinburgh, without date, but of
      considerable antiquity, and entitled Arthur's Seat shall be My Bed, etc.,

      As in all single hearts and primitive natures, the visible features of
      death, the white shroud and the grave, "hap'd with the sods sae green,"
      make a deep impression, and the imagination concerning the loved one lost
      is not lifted to spiritual forms, but dwells upon the painful figures of
      the charnel house. The ghosts that visit the living have the fatal breath
      of decaying mortality, and are summoned back by the cock to the winding
      sheet and the worm. The ballads that deal with this subject are all in the
      same strain, and repeat the same phrases. The lady asks her dead lover if
      there is any room at his head or any room at his feet in his new bed, and
      he answers that there is none, it is made so narrow, and that the worms
      are his only bedfellows; and warns her that he cannot give the kiss she
      craves, for his breath would be fatal. Sometimes the images of mortality
      are extremely powerful as well as grotesque, as in the ballad of Sweet
      William's Ghost:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My meikle toe is my gavil post,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      My nose is my roof tree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My ribs are kebars to my house;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      There is no room for thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they have a touch of homely pathos, which relieves them from the
      conventional note of sorrow, as when the three sons of The Wife of Usher's
      Well are called back to the grave by the crowing cock, and the youngest
      says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Fare ye weel, my mother, dear;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Farewell to barn and byre,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And fare ye weel, the bonny lass,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That kindles my mother's fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most interesting specimens of the ballads of this kind, as they
      exist to-day, borrowed in a modified form from the ancient, but embodying
      a still popular superstition, is The Unquiet Grave, recently taken down
      from the lips of a young girl in Sussex. It is founded on the belief,
      common to many primitive peoples, that excessive weeping disturbs the
      repose of the departed, and has a touch of that natural originality of
      description and that abruptness which presupposes a quickness of
      appreciation, which does not require an elaborate story to make the
      connection intelligible, characteristic of popular poetry, and which shows
      that the elements of mind to which it is addressed are always the same:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The wind doth blow to-day, my love,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And a few small drops of rain.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I never had but one true love&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In the cold grave she was lain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I 'll do as much for my true love
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As any young man may,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I 'll sit and mourn all at her grave
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For a twelvemonth and a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The twelvemonth and a day being up,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The dead began to speak:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "O, who sits weeping on my grave
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And will not let me sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "'T is I, my love, sits on your grave
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And will not let you sleep;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For I crave one kiss of your clay-cold lips,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And that is all I seek."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "You crave one kiss of my clay-cold lips,

    <p class="indent10">
      But your breath smells earthly strong;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      If you have one kiss of my clay-cold lips
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Your time will not be long."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'T is down in yonder garden green,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Love, where we used to walk:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The finest flower that e'er was seen
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Is withered on the stalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The stalk is withered dry, my love,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      So will our hearts decay:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So make yourself content, my love,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Till God calls you away.
    </p>
    <p>

      By far the larger number of the popular ballads had their origin in
      Scotland, and they are also of much finer quality than those of England.
      Even if the question of the origin of the ballad of Chevy Chace should be
      decided in favor of the latter, it would simply be localized upon the
      Border within the limit of Scottish influence. The English ballads are
      mostly heavy and dull, imperfect in form and expression, in comparison
      with the Scottish, and show few signs of the depth and glow of feeling in
      the burning words of the latter. The English ballads relating to King
      Arthur are greatly inferior in strength and spirit to the prose
      chronicles, and their dealing with the marvelous is coarse and commonplace
      in comparison with the spiritual and majestic mystery of the Welsh cycle
      of Arthurian romance. And the English ballads continued to degenerate,
      rather than improve, from the rude vigor of some of the Arthurian ballads,
      and took on the element of coarse humor which is characteristic of the
      Robin Hood cycle, from which nearly every gleam of poetry is eliminated.
      It may be said that the degeneracy of the English popular ballad was due
      to the spread of education among the people, and the development of their
      genius in more strictly literary forms under the influence of Chaucer and
      his associates. But the spread of education and the increase of literary
      production among the English people was by no means so general as to
      affect the quality of the popular ballad at this period, and certainly
      less than that which prevailed in Scotland at a later time, when the
      production of popular poetry was in its fullest flower. The adventures of
      the English outlaws, of whom Robin Hood, however mythical his actual
      existence, was the type, were not less stirring and full of the natural
      elements of poetry than those of the reivers and cattle thieves of the
      Scottish Border, but the ballads of the former cycle are only full of a
      vulgar peasant humor, while the latter are illuminated with the light of
      battle, and have the quarter staff and broken pate in place of the spear
      and the bleeding breast. Of Robin Hood it is said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then Robin took them both by the hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And danced about the oke tree;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For three merry men and three merry men
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And three merry men are we.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Lord of Branxholm cries:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Gae warn the water broad and wide,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Gae warn it sune and hastilie;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He that winna ride for Telfer's Kyle
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Let him neer look in the face o' me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and the difference in the spirit is reflected in the quality of the verse,
      the one dull and commonplace, suited to an audience of heavy-faced rustics
      in an alehouse, and the other full of fire and vigor, fit to be chanted in
      the dining hall of a Border chief. It is impossible to analyze
      ethnologically the causes of the great superiority of the Scottish popular
      poetry, or to define how much of the elevation of feeling and appreciation
      of the magic of nature came from the greater admixture of the Celtic
      element, which in its turn was given force and vigor, directness of
      expression and coherence of construction by the stronger nature of the
      invading element, which, for the want of a more definite term, is called
      Saxon. The effect of these influences is merely conjectural, as is also
      that of the country itself, its natural scenery, the disturbed life of the
      people, and the ferment of the popular mind. It can only be said that
      there was something in the national genius of the Lowland Scotch different
      from that of their more stolid neighbors at the south and their more
      mystical neighbors at the north, and which fitted them for the production
      of popular poetry in song and ballad at once elevated and impassioned, and
      which has resulted in a quantity and quality which no other province of
      the world has rivaled. It is known over the world, and has been translated
      into almost every literary language of Europe. To the English reader it is
      only necessary to give the titles to recall the verses that cling to the
      memory, and express the deepest glow of passion and pathos in words whose
      magic melody is beyond the reach of art, and which are winged with a force
      above the powers of uninspired speech. The Border Widow tells how she
      buried her slain husband:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I took his body on my back,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And whiles I gaed and whiles I sat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I digged a grave and laid him in,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">

    <p class="indent10">

    <p>
      These verses, and many like them, cling to the tongues and have sunk deep
      into the hearts of men, and will live until the speech in which they were
      created has passed away. The Flower of Yarrow will always utter her
      melodious lament so long as there is English poetry, and the Border
      moss-troopers will ride with spear in hand and "splent on spauld" until
      the valleys of the Tweed and the Tyne are inhabited by an alien race, and
      the songs in which they are sung have perished like those of the Assyrian
      shepherds.

      The collection and study of folk-song is being pursued with a vigor and a
      scholarly diligence which promises to leave no corner of the world
      unransacked, and no people, however simple and savage, neglected, and very
      valuable treasures of poetry have been and are being collected, which
      speak to the heart with the native eloquence of unsophisticated feeling
      and thought, and which give a more accurate knowledge of national
      temperament and of the stages of the development of the human intellect
      than any material remains or any historical records. But none have as yet
      been discovered, or are likely to be, which have a stronger power of
      original poetry, passion, and pathos, or which reveal a more vigorous and
      noble native genius than the ballads and songs which were produced within
      the limits of the little province between the Grampians and the Border.

    <h2>
      LADY NAIRNE AND HER SONGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The supreme felicity of lyric song is extremely rare even in the greatest
      masters of the art, and seems to come from something outside of
      themselves, some accident of the moment, some almost fortuitous
      intermingling of sound with meaning, which could have been attained by no
      ordinary inspiration and no deliberate skill, however accomplished and
      sure and strong the poetical organ which produced it. It is this supreme
      felicity, when it occurs, by which the lyric song of man, with only the
      elements of harsh and prosaic speech and common words to frame it, rivals
      the magic of the bird's note in joyous ecstasy or sorrow, and floods the
      heart, as it captivates the ear, with emotions sweeter and deeper, more
      ethereal and more mysterious, than life had seemed able to give. It is
      well known that singers, whose skill in the use of their vocal organs is
      the result of highly trained art, giving certainty and assurance to a
      great natural gift, and able at all times to command what seems the full
      extent of their power, sometimes have moments when they surpass themselves
      and exceed the limits of any art, when the voice touches a note of magic
      melody, which they can reach by no conscious effort even in the highest
      moments of inspiration, and which seems to come from some power not at
      their conscious command. It seems to be the same in lyric poetry, and when
      the power does come, then we have the touch which makes it song, as the
      thrill of the lark, and the ecstasy of the mocking-bird in the tropic
      night, are songs. The magic may not be prolonged through an entire lyric.
      It seldom is. It may be only in a single line or in a single verse. It may
      not be even the highest strain of feeling or nobility of sentiment, and
      may even carry with it little definite meaning upon analysis. It derives
      its power from the magic melody as much as from the feeling or the
      intelligible sense of the words, and its effect is indefinable by any law
      of the understanding. In its highest estate it combines the most
      penetrating feeling with not only perfect but magic melody, but it
      sometimes comes in a wild refrain, in which the meaning merely floats in
      the words, and the rhythm, the accent, the song itself, so to speak, is
      predominant. For the first instance there is the perfect example of Burns,
      the rapture caught once for a single strain in a song, which does not rise
      above the level of his accomplished skill otherwise, and which has the
      keenest and most penetrating feeling, joined to, and permeated by, the
      perfect and magic melody:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had we never loved sae blindly,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had we never loved sae kindly,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Never met and never parted,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We had ne'er been broken-hearted. 1
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second instance, where the melody is predominant over the meaning,
      and where the poet seemed only to be affected by the desire to frame words
      that would sing themselves and merely symbolize his thought, there are
      very many examples in the peasant poetry and folk-song of Scotland,&mdash;refrains
      that have no direct connection with the song, but, like the note of a
      second flute in a concerto, intensify the effect of the first strain by a
      kindred, yet diverse accentuation, as
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The broom blooms bonnie and says it is fair;
    </p>
    <p>
      and as the most perfect specimen that occurs, the refrain to the ballad of
      Lord Barnard in Jamieson's collection:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O, wow for day!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And dear gin it were day!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Gin it were day and I were away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For I haena long time to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only the uneducated poets who have the courage to use language
      arbitrarily with a purpose
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 It is needless to say that the supreme felicity of these
     lines has been pointed out by other and more distinguished
     critics.
</pre>
    <p>
      more for melody than for meaning, and when an attempt is made to reproduce
      its effect deliberately, as has been done by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and
      William Morris, the result is simply artificial and bizarre, in spite of
      the skill, the intensity, and the poetical power of Sister Helen, and the
      melody of the most perfect example of the modern imitation of the refrain
      in Morris's The Wind.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Wind, Wind, thou art sad, art thou kind?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Wind, Wind, unhappy; thou art blind,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Yet still thou wanderest the lily seed to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most perfect example of the lyric song, in which the melody is
      mingled with and sustains and elevates the feeling, and both are conjoined
      in an effect which melts the heart and possesses the ear, although the
      strain is not of so high a rapture of love or sorrow as parts of Burns's
      Ae Fond Kiss or Lady Anne Bothwell's Balow, and is of a peaceful sweetness
      and resignation rather than passion, is The Land of the Leal, by Carolina,
      Lady Nairne. In its original and simplest form, before she had
      interpolated a verse to express some of her theological ideas, it is the
      perfect interpretation of a sweet, solemn, and simple thought, the
      tenderest and purest emotion, breathed in an equally simple, but
      absolutely perfect melody, that is like the flowing of limpid water,
      crystal clear and unbroken to the end. The heart of the world has
      responded, and it has a place like none other in the tongue of song.

      The fame of the authoress, so far as she can be said to have any of her
      own individual personality, rests upon this song, and sufficiently, while
      the English language shall last, but it was not the solitary example of
      her genius, and her poetical work, although not great in hulk, contains
      other lyrics of a very high quality, with a wide range from high martial
      spirit and homely pathos to gay and frolicsome humor, and instinct with
      the vital and living element of song. Lady Nairne was almost morbidly
      anxious to retain her incognito as a writer during her life, so that her
      own husband and nearest relatives were not in the secret, and those who
      surmised or guessed it hardly dared to allude to it in her presence, and
      the veil has rested over her personality to a great degree in comparison
      with the flood of light poured over the words and actions of her great
      contemporaries, Scott and Burns, and many lesser figures in Scotch
      provincial literature like Professor Wilson and Hogg. Nevertheless, since
      her death at a very advanced age in 1846, her songs have been collected
      and published under her own name, and enough has been made known
      concerning her life and character to give to her poetry an individuality,
      and reveal a very gracious, noble and engaging figure.

      Carolina Oliphant was born in "the auld house of Gask," in Perthshire, on
      the 16th of August, 1766, six years later than Robert Burns. She came of
      stanch Jacobite stock on both sides, her father, Laurence Oliphant, a name
      since made familiar by the singular and notable career of the accomplished
      writer, traveler, and scholar, who puzzled the world not less by his naïve
      religious aberrations than by his accomplishments, took up arms for the
      Stuarts in "the Forty-five," and suffered attainder and temporary
      banishment in company with his father, who had also been "out" in the Earl
      of Mar's rebellion in "the Fifteen." Young Laurence Oliphant, while in
      exile at Versailles, married his cousin, Margaret Robertson, daughter of
      Duncan Robertson of Strowan, chief of the clan Dorrochy. The Robertsons
      had also been ardent Jacobites, and suffered in purse and person for their
      loyalty. The grandfather, Duncan Robertson, was notable in character and
      personality as well in adventure and misfortune, and had his portrait
      painted in immortal colors by Scott as the Baron of Bradwardine. Carolina,
      baptized after the exiled prince, spent her infancy and early childhood on
      the Continent in France and Belgium, under the care of her grandmother,
      her parents being in feeble health, and then returned with them to the old
      home at Gask, where she spent her happy, healthy, and gay youth and young
      womanhood. From a feeble and delicate child she had grown into a strong,
      vigorous, and beautiful young woman, the beauty of the country-side,
      called "the Flower of Strathearn" and "the lovely Car," and her life was
      of a kind to strengthen her ardent patriotism and cultivate her fondness
      for the native music, poetry, and song of which Scotland was full, but
      whose transcendent merits were unknown and unappreciated by the literary
      world until they were illuminated by the light of the genius of Burns a
      few years later. The anecdotes of her life give a very charming picture of
      innocent gayety, family affection, and friendship. She played the Jacobite
      airs for her aged grandfather, as she afterward wrote Jacobite songs for
      his pleasure, and with a skill and feeling which won the difficult
      approval of the famous Neil Gow, the wandering fiddler, whose skill on his
      instrument was like that of Scott's "Wandering Willie," and whose presence
      at a laird's house would draw all the young people for miles around to
      dance to the winged notes of his strathspeys and hornpipes. She was
      foremost in all scenes of gayety, and is said to have taken a carriage at
      midnight and driven several miles to bring one of her young lady friends
      out of bed for a party where partners were scarce. In the simple social
      pleasures of the local aristocracy, the county balls and meetings, and the
      gatherings of the tenantry, "the Flower of Strathearn" was a conspicuous
      figure, while her keen eyes were taking in the queer figures that appeared
      later in all the glow of bright humor in The Laird of Cockpen, The County
      Meeting, and Jamie, the Laird. Her first verses, The Ploughman, were
      written for a harvest home dinner, and were read by her brother as a
      contribution by an unknown author. About this time the first poems of
      Burns made their appearance, and stirred the heart of Scotland not less by
      their original genius than by the revivification of the old airs and
      scraps of songs, finished and cleansed of their coarseness, and made to
      speak to the hearts of the people in the drawing-room as well as in the
      peasant's cottage and the taproom of the country alehouse. It was the
      first acknowledgment, if not the beginning, of that appreciation of the
      wealth of pathos and humor in the peasant poetry of Scotland, among the
      cultivated classes, and drew that attention and emulation to which all
      there is of value in modern Scotch poetry is due. It was the inspiration
      of the genius of Carolina Oliphant, and from this time she began to write
      the new verses to the old airs, and to replace the imperfect, unworthy,
      and sometimes coarse and vulgar scraps of songs with the beautiful ones of
      her own, equally Scotch and racy of the soil, and full of the thoughts and
      sentiments as well as the dialect of the people. The old grandfather, worn
      with disease and living in the past light of fervid days, heard his
      favorite airs of welcome, gathering, and victory, for the Young Chevalier
      sung to new and glowing words, and the young ladies laughed at the funny
      lilts in which were drawn the queer figures of the dullards and provincial
      fops, without knowing to whose keen pen they were indebted. The Land o'
      the Leal was written for Mrs. Archibald Campbell Colquhoun, a dear friend
      of Miss Oliphant, upon the death of an infant daughter, and to one other
      only was the secret of its authorship ever definitely disclosed, although
      its aurora, more or less mysteriously, finally settled around the head of
      Lady Nairne. Mrs. Colquhoun was born Mary Anne Erskine, and was the sister
      of that William Erskine afterward Lord Kinedder who was the dearest friend
      and associate of Walter Scott in his early Edinburgh days, and the sister,
      who kept the house for her brother until her marriage with Mr. Colquhoun,
      was the earliest and deepest love of Scott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat late in life Carolina Oliphant married her cousin, Major William
      Nairne, the heir to the forfeited Barony of Nairne, Assistant Inspector
      General of Barracks in Scotland, and with him removed to Edinburgh, where
      she occupied for a time a cottage at Portobello and afterward official
      quarters in Holyrood place. The impulse given by Burns to the cultivation
      of native Scotch poetry still continued, and was being strengthened by his
      contributions of songs for the music of the old airs in Johnson's Museum,
      and a coterie of the literary ladies of Edinburgh established the Scotch
      Minstrel for the same purpose. To this Mrs. Nairne became a contributor,
      with a single friend for a confidant, under the name of "Mrs. Bogan of
      Bogan," with other pseudonyms, a disguised handwriting and other elaborate
      precautions for concealment. There was, of course, a keen curiosity to
      discover the author of these beautiful songs, but the secret was well
      guarded, and not even the husband was aware of it. "I dare not even tell
      William"&mdash; Mrs. Nairne wrote to her friend&mdash;"lest he blab." She
      and her friend at one time cherished the purpose of "cleansing and
      moralizing" the songs of Burns, as he had done those of his unknown
      predecessors, but a wiser second thought restrained them. Miss Oliphant
      had been "converted," as the phrase goes, when a young woman on a visit to
      England, and her piety and religious feeling deepened with her years,
      until it took on completely the rigid, depressing, and dismal forms of
      Scotch denominationalism, and her genius for poetry shriveled under it.
      During the visit of George the Fourth to Edinburgh he signalized his
      theatrical clemency by a restoration of the forfeited titles of the
      Jacobite nobility, and Major Nairne became Baron Nairne. Lord Nairne
      survived his restoration but a few years, and died in 1829, leaving his
      widow with an only son. To his education she devoted herself, residing for
      a time in Bath, afterward in Ireland, and traveling on the Continent for
      the health of the young lord, who was of feeble constitution, and who died
      at Brussels in 1837. It is painful to read of the narrow bigotry and
      theological gloom which enveloped the joyous and healthy spirit of Lady
      Nairne. She would not allow her son to be taught to dance, and regarded
      her poetry as the somewhat flagitious exercise of a worldly spirit, and
      spent her days in the doubt and self-affliction of a harsh creed and in
      the petty interests of a narrow church. She was deeply interested in the
      hopeless task of "converting" the Catholics of Ireland and the Jews to
      Scotch Presbyterianism, and was the mentor of her relatives after the
      fashion of Mrs. Hannah More, the patroness of bazaars, and at one time
      with her sister was expelled from an Italian town for distributing
      Protestant Bibles to the people. But her native nobleness of character
      shone through the theological clouds. She was regarded with affection as
      well as reverence by her younger relatives and her servants, and impressed
      all who came in contact with her by the cordial grace of her manners, and
      the aristocratic and highly marked contour of her features, which in the
      bloom of youth had made her "the Flower of Strathearn." Her benevolence
      was unceasing and self-sacrificing, if not always wisely directed, and at
      one time she had all her family plate sold and the proceeds sent to Dr.
      Chalmers for the support of an industrial school for the poor. She lived
      during her later years at the old house of Gask, the honored guest of her
      nephew and his wife, and died in 1845 at the advanced age of seventy-one,
      in peace and tranquillity, and with only the gentle decay of her mental
      faculties and bodily forces. The year after her death her poems were
      collected and published under her own name, and the world for the first
      time knew to whom it was indebted for the songs which had impressed
      themselves upon the popular heart and become a distinct and notable part
      of the lyric poetry of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been said, The Land o' the Leal reaches the highest note in its
      inspiration, perfection, and completeness, within the limits of its
      purpose, not only of Lady Nairne's work, but of all the lyric poetry of
      Scotland, but it was not the solitary example of a genius which had much
      of the versatility, if not the fecundity and strength, of Burns, in
      interpreting the emotions and the thoughts, the passions and the humors,
      of the Scotch people. Lady Nairne's poetical genius was entirely lyric.
      There was no Cotter's Saturday Night, much less any scene from Poosey
      Nancy's alehouse, or witch's gathering at Kirk Alloway, in her
      interpretation of Scotch life, and her voice was only the pure lilt of
      Scotch song, grave or gay. Without determined literary ambition and the
      responsibility of a known name, the stimulus of production was not
      absorbing and lasting, and a good deal of her work was simply occasional,
      careless, and imperfect. The best, that which will live as long as Scotch
      song, could be comprised within the limits of a dozen pages. But its
      quality is of the very highest in inspiration and execution, the pure
      voice of the lark lilting beneath the blue cloud, the mourning of the
      croodlin' doo, and the gay warble of the cheery thrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as famous in its own and very different way as The Land o' the
      Leal, and almost as perfect in its execution, the limitation of the true
      lyric to the simplest and most absolute words, and the complete
      interpretation of its spirit in the melody, is The Laird of Cockpen. It
      was written, it is said, to supply proper words to the gay old air of When
      She cam ben, She bobbit, which being interpreted, means that when she came
      into the front of the house, she curtsied, and of which the first verse of
      the imperfect and rather vulgar old song is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When she cam' ben, she bobbit,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When she cam' ben, she bobbit,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When she cam' ben she kissed Cockpen
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And syne denied that she did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one can doubt that it was the true picture of a character and
      incident which had given laughter to Carolina Oliphant and her young
      friends, and had been the joke of the country-side, ere it lilted itself
      to the rollicking jig. The commonly printed version of The Laird of
      Cockpen is injured by the fact that it has two additional verses,
      contributed by Miss Ferrier, the novelist, which destroy its absolute
      completeness and perfection of humor as it was written by Lady Nairne.

      The finest efflorescence of Scotch lyric poetry, which is the richest and
      finest in the English language, if not in the world, was that of the
      Jacobite era, and the influence which followed it and inspired the
      renaissance of Scotch song is the genius of Burns, Hogg, Cunningham, Lady
      Nairne, and many more of less distinction, who made a galaxy of singers
      hardly less remarkable in their way, as marking an era in literature, than
      the dramatists of the Elizabethan age. The genius of folk-song and ballad
      poetry had always been remarkably developed in Scotland, in comparison, at
      least, with England, and, in spite of many characteristics among the
      Lowlanders, worldly thrift, bitter and barren bigotry, and a sort of
      dourness and hardheadedness, not calculated to encourage sentiment and
      emotion; and the student of racial distinctions may be inclined to
      attribute it to the influence of Celtic blood and tradition, creating a
      vein of sensitiveness, tenderness, and susceptibility to the magic of song
      and music in the strong and hard fabric of the Saxon character. But from
      whatever cause the tendency of the native genius was created, its
      existence was obvious, and from the very earliest time, since song began
      to be preserved in written words, the quality and quantity of Scotch
      folk-poetry and folk-music have been remarkable. The native faculty and
      the inherited tendency were all present when the spark of an inspiration,
      involving all the elements of patriotism, daring adventure, personal
      devotion, despair, and lamentation, gave fire to the genius of national
      poetry. All the incidents and events of the Rebellion of Forty-five, the
      landing of the young Prince Charles at Moidart with only seven followers,
      the blaze of fiery loyalty that swept through the Highlands at his call,
      the extraordinary victories won by the sheer impetus and hand-to-hand
      onslaughts of the Highland clans, the picturesque entry into Edinburgh and
      the gallant court of Holyrood, the swift march into England, which seemed
      at one time to promise to carry the Chevalier into St. James's Palace by
      its rush, the retreat and disorganization, and finally the woeful
      slaughter of Culloden, followed by the attainders and executions and the
      romantic adventures of the Prince in hiding from his hunters among the
      mountains and islands, all contrived to create themes for song and poetry
      which have never been surpassed in modern history. The enterprise was as
      foolish as it was daring, an episode of knight-errantry after the age when
      success was possible, but it had all the elements of chivalry in its
      impulse and conduct, and no modern war has been less selfish and sordid,
      not even the insurrections of Poland or the uprising of the Spanish and
      German people against Napoleon. The young Chevalier himself, only
      twenty-four years of age, tall, handsome, and martial, with his flowing
      yellow hair and Tartan dress, and with the fascination of his race in his
      manner, his courage, clemency, and misfortune, gave it the personal
      element so necessary to the highest poetry, and altogether the
      circumstances and the conditions combined to create an effervescence of
      popular poetry which has never been surpassed. Its quantity was as
      remarkable as its quality. The two large volumes of Hogg's Jacobite Relics
      by no means exhausted the collection of songs in the Lowland dialect, and
      to this day those in Gaelic are still being discovered by the labors of
      Professor Blackie and others, as they are yet preserved in the bothies of
      the Highlands and the islands. The inspiration of the later poets, Burns,
      Hogg, Cunningham, and
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Nairne, was hardly less strong, fed as it was upon the vivid
      traditions and by the stories and histories of the men living about them,
      or of their own families, full of all the elements of poetry, and their
      purpose to vivify and recreate the native song of Scotland must have had
      its most fertile impulse and material in the Jacobite songs, of which the
      country is full. In Lady Nairne the ancestral and personal impulse must
      have been especially strong. Her father and mother had been married in
      exile; her grandfather had been distinguished for his services as well as
      for his misfortunes, and upon both sides her family had been notable for
      more than one generation for its loyalty and its importance in the Scotch
      struggle for the restoration of the Stuarts. An old ballad says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Gask and Strowan were nae slack,
    </p>
    <p>
      and letters of thanks and tokens of gratitude from the royal hands were
      heirlooms of the houses. It was a keen pleasure to the grandfather in his
      old age to hear the songs and the music which had illumined the unhappy
      cause, and it is no wonder that the earliest inspiration of the young
      poetess was from such themes, and her keenest reward to see the blood
      warming more freely the old man's worn cheeks as she sang the new and
      stirring words to the old airs, and found the token of her success in his
      appreciation. The greater portion of her Jacobite songs were composed
      under this inspiration, and so long as she wrote at all they were her
      favorite themes. They are among the finest in what may be termed the
      modern Jacobite songs, unsurpassed by anything of the kind by Burns, Hogg,
      or Cunningham, and only so by that consummate flower of all Scotch
      Jacobite poetry by William Glen:&mdash;

      The story of The Hundred Pipers an' A' is historically correct in that
      there were so many musicians of the class attached to the little army of
      the Prince, and that the Highland lads did dance themselves dry to the
      pibroch's sound after fording the Esk, but it was not on the advance to
      Carlisle, but on the retreat from England, and the scene had doubtless
      been often described by the old laird of Strowan.

      Burns, Hogg, and Lady Nairne all wrote songs to the beautiful air of
      Charlie is my Darling, embodying in each case the first verse of the
      unknown poet who originated the song. They are all beautiful, but the
      words of Lady Nairne have conquered in the popular ear, and taken final

      There is one of Lady Nairne's songs not quite perfect, for one forced and
      faulty line in the refrain, which has a higher touch of the imagination
      than any of the others. The influence of the magic of nature in the
      interpretation of human sorrow or gladness, and the wild mystery of the
      birds' melody upon the heart, which is characteristic of the highest order
      of the folk-song, and which, in its irregularity and simplicity, not less
      than the melody, which is nature's own voice, rather than the rhythm of
      art, is beyond the reach of any deliberate skill. It would be hard to find
      anything more perfect at once in its picture and its interpretation of the
      voice of nature in human words than&mdash;

      In one other famous song, heard wherever Scotch music is sung, Lady Nairne
      interpreted the pathos, hardship, and suffering behind the strong, clear
      voices of the Newhaven fishwives, which may still be heard in the wynds
      and closes of Edinburgh as they march on their sturdy limbs with the heavy
      creels laden with the silvery fishes on their backs, and fill the air with
      their deep, melodious cry.

      There are other verses to Caller Herrin', but they were merely occasional,
      intended to serve as a benefit to Nathaniel Gow, the son of the famous

      The poetical work of Lady Nairne was smaller in bulk than that of her
      chief contemporaries, even than that of Allan Cunningham. She was without
      any personal literary ambition whatever, and her inspiration was smothered
      by domestic grief and an absorbing and narrow piety. A portion of what
      there is is also imperfect, ephemeral, and careless, but she has written
      one of the most perfect lyrics in the English language, and a number of
      others, which, in their melody, their interpretation of simple emotion,
      their vividness and strength, and their power upon the heart as well as
      the ear, have a place which few have equaled and none have surpassed in
      the lyric treasures of a land more rich than all others in the voice of
      poetry speaking to the heart in song.

    <h2>
      SIR SAMUEL FERGUSON AND CELTIC POETRY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he great
      controversy over the genuineness of the Ossianic poems of James
      Macpherson, which existed during his lifetime and was carried on for a
      considerable period after his death, has died away without being settled.
      Opinions of eminent Celtic scholars still differ as to whether the
      so-called Gaelic originals of his poems, published after his death, were
      genuine transcripts from ancient poems, or were translations into the
      Gaelic from Macpherson's English composition made by his friends to
      conceal the fraud and maintain provincial pride. He himself never produced
      the originals of his poems, and took refuge in a silence which went far to
      confirm the impression of fraud and forgery. But whether he had any direct
      originals or not, and the weight of probability is that he had not, his
      poems were unquestionably founded on the vast mass of Celtic poetry and
      legend existing in Ireland and Scotland in tradition and manuscript. The
      names of his heroes, their characters and their exploits, are to be found
      in this poetry, and many of his most admired episodes and descriptions,
      like that of Ossian's address to the sun, and the description of
      Cuchullin's chariot, were taken directly from it. Whatever the amount of
      transformation and interpolation, and whatever the change in the literary
      style, from the plain and simple expressions of primitive poetry to the
      vague and rhetorical imagery of inflated artifice, were made by
      Macpherson, he unquestionably preserved the pervading spirit of Celtic
      poetry, its melancholy, its sensitiveness to the impressions of nature,
      and its lofty and humane spirit, and was the first to make it known to the
      world. Critics like Hazlitt and Matthew Arnold, who were impressed simply
      by its spirit of pure poetry, and the most accomplished Celtic scholars of
      a later day, have alike agreed upon internal and external evidence as to
      the faithfulness of the reproduction of the spirit of Celtic poetry by
      Macpherson, and have regarded the faults of his literary style as those of
      the age, and his interpretation of the poems of Ossian by the spirit of
      the eighteenth century as not more faulty or less natural than Chapman's
      transfusion of Homer into the style of the Elizabethan era, or Pope's into
      that of Queen Anne. His great drawback was the suspicion of absolute fraud
      and forgery which attached to him, and which he was unable to dispel, from
      his mistake in not acknowledging in the beginning that his poems were
      derived from general tradition instead of being absolute translations from
      originals. But in spite of this discredit, which was more of a personal
      literary quarrel than a critical attack upon the quality of the poetry
      itself, its value was at once instinctively recognized as a new and
      original revelation, as an appeal to sensibilities in human nature which
      had been stifled by the narrow and dry reasoning of English and
      Continental poetry at the time, and as a breath from the wide air of
      nature itself. It touched the European spirit, then struggling to
      emancipate itself from the swaddling bands of authority and artificial
      society, with electric power, and was a powerful influence in the
      emancipation both of literature and human action. Ossian profoundly
      affected the intellectual awakening of Goethe and was a favorite with
      Napoleon, and throughout the whole of Europe its spirit was an inspiring
      and governing force. In English literature its effect was not less
      powerful, although less openly acknowledged owing to the discredit created
      by the charges of forgery, and both Byron's melancholy and Wordsworth's
      appreciation of the soul of nature were derived from this pervading spirit
      of ancient Celtic poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as the direct study of Celtic poetry was concerned the Ossianic
      controversy was unquestionably a misfortune. It threw a cloud of suspicion
      and discredit upon the genuine fragments which remained, and discouraged
      the study which might otherwise have been given to them, so that,
      unquestionably, some traditional Celtic poetry has been lost by the decay
      of the language as a living speech, and it is only in later years that
      enlightened scholarship and patriotic feeling have led to the careful and
      appreciative study of the manuscript volumes which have survived time and
      neglect, for their inherent literary and historical value, and to a
      consideration of the influence of the Celtic spirit upon English
      literature. They have been found to be of great value and interest, to
      possess elements of pure poetry of marked and original quality, and a
      spirit which has had a strong effect upon English literature. Nevertheless
      there has not been found in the remains of Celtic literature any single
      poem which in itself would compare with the Nibelungen Lied or with the
      Song of Roland, in epic form and constructiveness, in clearness of diction
      and dramatic strength; nor even any prose legend or narrative history,
      which would compare with the clear and vigorous character drawing and
      lucid narration of the Icelandic and Scandinavian Sagas. What would have
      been the case had the original poems and histories of the sixth century
      been preserved can only be conjectured. Those which now exist are only in
      the transcripts of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries,
      greatly transformed, altered, and confused in dates and characters, and
      bearing the marks of a great deterioration in style, like the degradation
      of Latin prose in its later era. The passages which competent Celtic
      scholars have pronounced from philological evidence to be of an earlier
      construction, are a good deal stronger as well as simpler in expression
      than those by which they are surrounded, and indicate that, if the earlier
      poetry had been preserved in its purity without being amplified and
      weakened by scholastic and artificial phraseology, it might have rivaled
      the early Teutonic poetry in force, directness and simplicity, and
      strength of construction. As it is, the Celtic poems and histories are not
      only confused and prolix with interminable genealogies and proverbial
      reflections, but are written in a style, with a redundance and
      complication of epithets, at once weakening and tiresome. Thus in an Irish
      history of the Triumphs of Turlogh O'Brien, written in the thirteenth
      century, there is the following description of the dress and arms of a
      hero:&mdash;"His noble garment was first brought to him, viz., a strong,
      well-formed, close-ridged, defensively-furrowed, terrific, neat-bordered,
      new-made, and scarlet-red cassock of fidelity; he expertly put on that
      gold-bordered garment, which covered him as far as from the lower part of
      his soft, fine, redwhite neck, to the upper part of his expert, snowwhite,
      round-knotted knee. Over that mantle he put on a full, strong,
      white-topped, wide-round, gold-bordered, straight, and parti-colored coat
      of mail, well-fitted, and ornamented with many curious devices of
      exquisite workmanship. He put on a beautiful, thick, and saffron-colored
      belt of war, embellished with clasps and buckles set with precious stones,
      and hung with golden tassels; to this belt was hung his active and trusty
      lance, regularly cased in a tubic sheath, but that it was somewhat greater
      in height than the height of the sheath; he squeezed the brilliant, gilt,
      and starry belt about the coat of mail; and a long, blue-edged,
      bright-steeled, sharp-pointed, broad-sided, active, whitebacked,
      half-polished, monstrous, smooth-bladed, small-thick, and well-fashioned
      dagger was fixed to the tie of that embroidered and parti-colored belt; a
      white, embroidered, full-wide, strong, and well-wove hood was put on him
      over his golden mail; he himself laid on his head a strong-cased,
      spherical, towering, polished-shining, branch-engraved, long-enduring
      helmet; he took his edged, smooth-bladed, letter-graved, destructive,
      sharp-pointed, fight-taming, sheathed, gold-guarded, and girded sword,
      which he tied fast in haste to his side."
    </p>
    <p>
      The confusion which exists in the transcripts of the ancient poems between
      the pagan mythology and the Christian faith, and the superposition of
    </p>
    <p>
      Latin learning and mediaeval thought, is also a great injury to the
      consecutiveness and vraisemblance of the story, and the effect is as if
      the tale of the Nibelungen Lied had been told by a monkish chronicler with
      all the embellishments of a later faith and the ornaments of an artificial
      style. The poetry has not all perished from the earlier originals, and in
      many instances there is a vigor of narrative, a poetical power of
      description, and an elevation of sentiment, which shines through the
      amplification and verbiage, and redeems the prolixity and tediousness of
      the story; but, as has been said, the prevailing impression is one of a
      corrupted and weakened, instead of a strong and original primitive poetry,
      and a literal translation of an Irish or Scotch Celtic poem or history is
      not likely to attract the general reader from its purely literary quality.
      The poetry lies in a heap of dross, and must be painfully smelted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way in which ancient Celtic poetry can be known and appreciated
      by the English reader, and have its effect in English literature, is by
      the presentation of its spirit and atmosphere, its essential elements in
      local form and color, its characteristic phraseology and tone of thought
      in English poetry of original power as well as essential faithfulness. The
      poet who is to do this successfully must have, what Macpherson had not, a
      thorough knowledge of the language and an appreciation of its method as
      the expression of thought, be completely saturated with the knowledge of
      the time, and possess the literary conscience and taste to be completely
      faithful to the original spirit. The most conspicuous example in our time
      of an attempt to reproduce the spirit of legendary romance in original
      poetry is, of course, The Idylls of the King, and the impress of a very
      thorough study and saturation of the spirit of the ancient chronicles is
      as visible as the exquisite substance of original poetry. But the stories
      of The Idylls of the King are based upon, rather than' closely reproduce,
      the legends of Arthurian romance, and the spirit has been elevated and
      refined by that of modern poetry and the nature of Tennyson's own genius
      to essential unreality. They are like the pictures of Madonnas and
      mediaeval saints done by a modern painter of genius with all the skill and
      technique of art, but without the sense of devotion which shows through
      the ruder sketches of the earlier and greatly inferior painters, who were
      inspired by something more than merely artistic enthusiasm. It is needless
      to say that for a poet to possess the self-restraint to be entirely
      faithful to his originals, and aim mainly at reproducing their form as
      well as spirit, is more rare, and may be said to have less power, than one
      who creates an original structure of poetry upon the basis of ancient
      romance; but he has his function also, and may be something more than a
      mere translator, as he gives his material shape in modern form and with
      the embellishments of his own genius, while he yet preserves the ancient
      characteristics. He is like the skillful architect who restores a ruined
      castle to a habitable dwelling, clearing away the rubbish which has choked
      its portals and surrounded its walls, while preserving its ancient shape
      and structure, and blending his new materials with the old so that it
      seems a harmonious building. This is the work to which Sir Samuel Ferguson
      has devoted himself in his reproduction of Irish Celtic poetry, both
      ballad and epic, and particularly in his poem of Congal, which is a
      recreation of the bardic romance of the Battle of Moyra, and its
      introductory Pre-Tale of the Banquet of Dunangay, prose versions which
      have been given by the eminent Celtic scholar, Dr. John O'Donovan, in the
      publications of the Irish Archaeological Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle of Moyra was an authentic historic event, and took place A. D.
      637 between the forces of Domnal, king of Ireland, and those of Congal,
      sub-king of Ulster, and his allies, from Scotland, Wales, England,
      Brittany, and Scandinavia. It is regarded by Celtic historians as the last
      struggle of the bardic and pagan party in Ireland against the newly
      established power of Christianity, for which a pretext rather than a cause
      was found in an alleged slight of Domnal to Congal. The history, which is
      in prose interspersed with speeches and exhortations in verse in the usual
      manner of the bardic chronicles, was apparently written in its present
      form in the latter part of the eleventh century, and from earlier
      traditionary chronicles, which are now lost. Its style has a good deal of
      vigor and force, but is marked with the faults of confusion, and the
      redundance of 'descriptive epithets characteristic of the writers of the
      time. Its story is that Congal, having been invited by Domnal to a banquet
      at the royal house at Dunangay, was served with a hen's egg upon a wooden
      platter, instead of with a goose egg upon a silver dish, as were the
      remainder of the company, and, denouncing it as an unforgivable insult,
      departed to seek assistance from his relatives and 'allies in Great
      Britain and the Continent. Returning with these a great battle was fought
      on the plains of Moyra, which lasted for six days, and in which the
      foreign invaders were routed and Congal was killed. The principal heroes
      of the chronicle were historical personages, but there were others of
      which there is no definite knowledge, and who probably owed their origin
      to the imagination of the bards, as in the Iliad and the Nibelungen Lied.
      Sir Samuel Ferguson's poem of Congal follows the main narrative of events
      in the original chronicle, but with an addition in the shape of a love
      episode between Lafinda, a sister of Sweeny, an Irish prince, and Congal,
      the introduction of several new characters, and of some supernatural
      episodes derived from the pagan mythology of Ireland. The narrative is
      made intelligible where it is obscure in the original, and incredible
      events, such as the chaining together of the warriors lest they should run
      away from each other, are omitted, while the tautology and verbiage of the
      language is eliminated. Its faithfulness as the reproduction of an ancient
      Celtic poem consists in the skill with which the characteristic style of
      language, its multiplied and doubled epithets, is renewed in English
      without the effect of archaism, and the reproduction of its heroic and
      primitive tone and spirit. Its original merits are the force and vigor of
      the narrative, the vivid descriptions of scenery, the strength and
      impressiveness of the supernatural figures, the genuine inspiration of
      battle in the combats, and the easy mastery of the "long, resounding line"
      in the verse. There is no modern poem which so thoroughly reproduces the
      ancient form and spirit of a bygone age, and in which so complete and
      accurate an idea can be obtained of the element of a vanished poetry as in
      Congal, and, as has been said, it is like a restoration in shape and
      substance of a ruined castle. The opening lines give a specimen of the
      style of the verse and the vigorous spirit of the measure:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The Hosting here of Congal Claen. 'T was loud lark-car
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      oling May
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When Congal, as the lark elate and radiant as the day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Rode forth from steep Rath-Keltar gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the felicity with which these double descriptive epithets are used
      there are a thousand specimens, such as
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The white-maned, proud-neck-arching tide;
    </p>
    <p>
      and they give the dominant characteristic of the style as in the original,
      with a grace and appropriateness which make them a natural part of the
      English language. In order to show how the Celtic narrative has been
      transformed into English poetry without losing its characteristic
      features, the two accounts of the episode in the battle in which Sweeny
      becomes smitten with a frenzy of fear by supernatural visitation may be
      compared. This is the original:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fits of giddiness came over him at <i>the sight</i> of the horrors,
      grimness, and rapidity of the Gaels; at the looks, brilliance, and
      irksomeness of the foreigners; at the rebounding, furious shouts and
      bellowings of the various embattled tribes on both sides, rushing against
      and coming into collision with one another. Huge, flickering, horrible,
      aerial phantoms rose up, so that they were in curved, commingled crowds
      tormenting him; and in dense, rustling, clamorous, life-tormenting hordes,
      without ceasing; and in dismal, regular, aerial, storm-shrieking,
      hovering, fiend-like hosts, constantly in motion, shrieking and howling as
      they hovered about them in every direction, to cow and dismay cowards and
      soft youths, but to invigorate and mightily rouse champions and warriors;
      so that from the uproar of the battle, the frantic pranks of the demons,
      and the clashing of arms, the sound of heavy blows reverberating on the
      points of heroic spears, and keen edges of swords, and the war-like
      borders of broad shields, the noble hero Suibne was filled and intoxicated
      with tremor, horror, panic, dismay, fickleness, unsteadiness, fear,
      flightiness, giddiness, terror, and imbecility; so that there was not a
      joint or member of him from foot to head which was not converted into a
      confused, shaking mass, from the effect of fear and the panic of dismay.
      His feet trembled as if incessantly shaken by the force of a stream; his
      arms and various-edged weapons fell from him, the power of his hands
      having been enfeebled and relaxed around them, and rendered incapable of
      holding them. The inlets of hearing were quickened and expanded by the
      horrors of lunacy; the vigor of his brain in the cavities of his head was
      destroyed by the clamors of the conflict; his heart shrunk within him with
      the panic of dismay; his speech became faltering from the giddiness of
      imbecility; his very soul fluttered with hallucination, and with many and
      various phantoms, for that was the root and true basis of fear itself. He
      might be compared on this occasion to a salmon in a weir, or to a bird
      after being caught in the strait prison of a crib."

      Perhaps, however, the greatest strength in Congal will be found in the
      dealing with the apparitions, the gigantic and malign demons, who haunt
      the hill and the stream, and represent the primitive imaginings of a race
      not yet emancipated from the terrors of the supernatural in the forces and
      forms of nature. These figures of ancient Irish poetry, the Herdsman
      Borcha, who swept down Finn's fortress with his staff, and counts the kine
      in the unconquered lands, the Giant Walker, who strides angrily around the
      hostile camp at night, and the Washer at the Ford, who dabbles with slain
      men's heads, live again in Ferguson's verse with their original reality
      and terror, and amid the setting of natural scenery from which their
      phantoms were created. This is the picture of the Giant Walker, whose
      apparition presaged doom to Cougal at his first night's camp:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

    <p class="indent5">

      A conspicuous feature of the excellence of Congal as an original poem is
      the vividness and faithfulness with which the natural scenery of Ireland
      is painted. The dark and barren hills, the tawny and foam-flecked streams,
      the misty seas, the vast and lonely raths and burial places of heroes, the
      emerald fields bathed with dew and glittering with sunshine, all the
      characteristics of Irish scenery, with their soul of meaning, which
      appeals to the heart as well as the outward form to the eye, are depicted
      with remarkable power, and make a living element in which the figures
      move. Almost every page has a touch of this skill, and every aspect of
      field and sea and sky is enlivened. As fine a specimen as any is this
      picture of an autumn champaign from a hilltop in Leinster:&mdash;

      With its faithfulness to tone and character, its skillful reproduction of
      style and language, its force and vigor of narrative, its forms of
      mythologie mysticism and its appreciation of the magic of nature, Congal
      is the most perfect reproduction of the form and spirit of ancient Celtic
      poetry in existence, and from it the English reader, who is not a Celtic
      student, can obtain the best knowledge of its pervading elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congal is not the only contribution made by Sir Samuel Ferguson to Celtic
      poetry. The Lays of the Western Gael are a series of ballads founded on
      events in Celtic history and derived from the early chronicles and poems.
      They are original in form and substance, the ballad form and measure being
      unknown to the early Celtic poets of Ireland, but they preserve in a
      wonderful degree the ancient spirit, and give a picture of the ancient
      times with all the art of truth and verity. As I have said elsewhere 1:&mdash;

      and is felt by the instinct of nature to be true and real, free from

      thought, through the inevitably imperfect knowledge of a language half
      faded and changed, while preserving not only the terms of expression but
      the characteristics of thought and feeling, seems a no less difficult task
      than to trace and interpret the worn letters and half-effaced inscriptions
      on the Ogham stones, and could only have been done by the genius of the
      great poet vivifying the labor of the profound scholar. Finally, the
      impress of the past as it is visible to the present, the effect of the
      gray cairn and grassy burial mound, and almost the last fading of the
      tokens of the aboriginal race into the bosom of nature, and the perception
      of its spirit amid the light and bustle of the day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The loneliness and awe secure of the forgotten dead,
    </p>
    <p>
      is the task of the modern poet speaking in his own time and to his own
      generation of the past."

     1 Introduction to popular edition of  <i>Lays of the Western
     Gael</i> Dublin, 1888.
</pre>
    <p>
      These ballads have a solemnity of measure like the voice of one of the
      ancient bards chanting of
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Old, forgotten, far-off things
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And battles long ago,
    </p>
    <p>
      and they are clothed with the mists of a melancholy age. They include such
      subjects as The Tain Quest, the search of the bard for the lost lay of the
      great cattle raid of Queen Maev of Connaught, and its recovery by
      invocation from the voice of its dead author arising in misty form above
      his grave; The Healing of Conall Carnach, a story of violated sanctuary
      and its punishment; The Welshmen of Tyrawly, one of the most spirited and
      original, and which has been pronounced by Mr. Swinburne as among the
      finest of modern ballads, telling of a cruel mulct inflicted upon the
      members of a Welsh colony in Ireland and its vengeance, and other
      incidents in early Irish history. The verses on Aideen's Grave are a
      characteristic specimen of the tone and spirit of these ballads. The
      author's introductory note says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aideen, daughter of Angus of Ben Edar (now the Hill of Howth), died of
      grief for the loss of her husband Oscar, son of Ossian, who was slain at
      the battle of Gavra (Gowra near Tara in Meath) A. D. 284. Oscar was
      entombed in the rath, or earthen fortress, that occupied part of the field
      of battle, the rest of the slain being cast in a pit outside. Aideen is
      said to have been buried on Howth, near the mansion of her father, and
      poetical tradition represents the Fenian heroes as present at her
      obsequies. The cromlech in Howth Park is supposed to have been her
      sepulchre."

      They heaved the stones; they heaped the cairn.

      Said Ossian, "In a queenly grave

    <p class="indent5">
      At Gavra, when by Oscar's side

      With hands on all their javelin loops

      The charming lyrics of the later Irish Celtic poetry, which succeeded that
      of the bards, and were the voices of the peasant people themselves and of
      the professional descendants of the bards, the itinerant poets and
      musicians, who wandered from house to house with their harps, singing the
      praises of their entertainers, and were not extinct until the end of the
      last century, have found an adequate interpreter in Sir Samuel Ferguson.
      As in his reproductions of the bardic poetry, he has been able to seize
      the very spirit of these songs, their intoxication of love, their breath
      of hopeless longing and misfortune, the characteristics of the race and
      the results of their cruel fate at the hands of alien conquerors, and to
      interpret it in measures as melodious as the sad and sweet old airs, which
      are the most valuable gift which the intellectual life of Celtic Ireland
      has bestowed upon posterity. The genuine Irish melodies are to be found in
      these lyrics, which interpret the spirit as well as the language of the
      Celtic poets, and not in the rococo songs of Moore, in which artificial
      sentiment is tricked out in a mechanical melody, and in which the
      atmosphere of the drawing-room takes the place of the free air of the
      hillside. Of these Celtic lyrics the greater number have been lost, the
      airs alone surviving, but those which remain show how strong, sensitive,
      and impassioned was the poetic spirit of the Irish Celtic people, and
      which, but for the misfortunes of the nation, might have left as rich a
      treasury of lyric song as the Scotch. The following is a specimen of the
      impassioned spirit of these songs, almost an improvisation, the very cry
      of the heart finding vent at the lips. It is entitled Cean Dubh Deelish&mdash;The
      Dear Black Head.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Put your head, darling, darling, darling,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Your darling black head my heart above;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Oh, mouth of honey, with the thyme for fragrance,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Who with heart in breast could deny you love?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Oh, many and many a young girl for me is pining,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Letting her locks of gold to the cold wind free,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For me the foremost of our gay young fellows;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But I'd leave a hundred, pure love, for thee:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

      Who, with heart in breast, could deny you love?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The verses entitled The Fair Hair'd Girl express with great sweetness the
      sense of woe and sorrow which forms the burden of so much of the Celtic
      poetry, and which is only relieved by occasional flashes of intoxicated
      merriment with the glass of whiskey for its stimulus and inspiration.

      The main literary work of Sir Samuel Ferguson was devoted to this
      revivification of the spirit of ancient Celtic poetry, in spite of a
      highly successful début as an English poet in The Forging of the Anchor,
      which at once took its place among those poems that are the familiar
      treasures of the people, and in this he was doubtless governed by
      something of patriotic spirit as well as by natural predilection. His work
      is not great in quantity, and he treasured his inspiration and perfected
      his workmanship with careful pains. Its result is to give a reproduction
      of the pervading elements of Irish Celtic poetry in English form with
      almost absolute perfection, and imbued with a spirit of original genius.
      In his poems, rather than in Macpherson's Ossian or in the literal
      translations, will the modern reader find the voice of the ancient Celtic
      bards speaking to the intelligence of to-day in their own tones without
      false change and dilution, or the confusion and dimness of an ancient
      language. The value of this work has not yet been fully appreciated by
      literary critics, but there is no doubt in my mind but that it eventually
      will be,

    <h2>
      WILLIAM THOM, THE WEAVER POET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne of the most
      extraordinary and painful lives in literary history was that of William
      Thom of Inverury,
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotland. There have been Scottish poets before and since Burns who have
      been bred in poverty and distress, and in whose lives the flowers of
      poetry have bloomed amid the most depressing and uncongenial
      circumstances. There have been crofters, shepherds, farm laborers,
      tailors, weavers, and shoemakers, servant lassies and old wives, who have
      given expression to their feelings in verse and song, with more or less
      skill and success, and testified to the strength of the national genius
      which has made Scotland so peculiarly the land of song, and filled the
      lower bed of bracken and furze in which the higher and rarer flowers of
      Scottish minstrelsy have stood preeminent. And the history of the minor
      Scottish poets is full of the homely pathos of unrequited toil, of
      pinching poverty, and of hopeless struggles with life, redeemed by honest
      virtue, patience, and thrift, or clouded with still deeper misfortune, and
      absolutely and irredeemably wrecked by dissipation and improvidence. But
      upon none, in whom the divine spark of genius existed, did the burdens of
      life fall more heavily than upon William Thom, or the tragedies of
      existence reach a blacker depth of misery. The story has been told by
      himself in The Rhymes and Recollections of a Handloom Weaver, his only
      volume, in nervous and vigorous prose, bearing traits of the declamatory
      style of Ebenezer Elliot and the radical writers of his school, but marked
      by native originality and strength. It has more than a personal value, as
      illustrating the condition of the life of factory hands in Scotland, when
      machines had multiplied to the complete degradation of labor, and when it
      was simply a question with the mill owners of extracting the largest
      amount of work for the smallest wages from the operatives, and before the
      government had interfered to regulate the hours of labor within endurable
      limits, and secure some of the conditions of health to the mill hands. A
      more appalling picture of hopeless poverty and starvation, and physical
      and moral degradation, has never been given in the annals of the civilized
      world, and of its truth there is abundant evidence in the writings of
      contemporary workingmen in England and Scotland, and in the testimony
      which led to the passage of the Factory Regulation acts by the English
      Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Thom was born in 1798 of parents steeped in poverty, in a tenement
      in one of the narrow closes of Aberdeen, and at the age of ten began his
      apprenticeship to life in a cotton factory. At the age of fifteen or
      sixteen he entered the "School Hill Factory,"&mdash;a building since swept
      away,&mdash;as a weaver hand, and remained there for seventeen years. The
      wages of the best operatives averaged through good and bad times from six
      to nine shillings weekly, and of the second-class from three to five
      shillings. The daily hours of labor were fourteen. What that meant, not in
      poverty, but in absolute want of food, warmth, and the means for the
      sustenance of life, the degradation of rags, the shutting out of all
      glimpses of heaven and earth, leaving the only alleviation to the hours of
      toil at the rattling machines, and the squalid suffering in the reeking
      tenements, in the cheap and fiery stimulants of the taprooms, can be only
      faintly imagined. An inheritance of bad habits had also descended to the
      weaving class. When the factories were first established in 1770, after
      the invention of the spinning jenny, the wages of skillful workmen were
      forty shillings a week, and the operatives usually remained drunk from
      Saturday night until Wednesday morning, wore frilled shirts and powdered
      hair, sported canes, and quoted Volney in their discussions on the rights
      of man in the taprooms. The overplus of labor gradually reduced the wages
      to the starvation point, while the habits of dissipation and recklessness
      remained as characteristic of the craft. Thom gives a most affecting
      picture of the lives and thoughts of these men, many of them, strong with
      native intellect and passion, condemned to a life of unending servitude
      and degradation, too ragged to dare to enter a church, even if they
      wished, and getting their only glimpse of nature in the garden of Gordon's
      Hospital, which was open on the Sunday holiday, while the whiskey shop
      gave them their only taste of joy and exhilaration; and yet who had a
      native feeling for poetry, repeating the verses of Burns and particularly
      of Tannahill, their brother weaver, as they tended their looms, and
      applauding the poets and singers in their own ranks, whose rude verses
      expressed their feelings or appealed to their sympathies in the gatherings
      in the taprooms. The moral influences of such a life, where three or four
      hundred men and women were herded together in common workrooms was also
      very bad, and many a young girl dated her ruin in life, bringing
      additional desolateness to the miserable home, from the promiscuous
      association, and being barred out into the streets with a heavy fine for
      failing to be at the factory door at its opening in the early morning. How
      virtue, morality, or any of the decency and self-respect of humanity could
      exist at all in such a life may be considered a marvel, and it is a proof
      of the inherent strength of the Scottish character and its inherited
      virtues that these factories were not greater plague spots than they
      actually were, and that honest lives and Tinman affections flourished at
      all. In a poem, entitled Whisperings to the Unwashed, in the fiercely
      declamatory style of the Corn Law Rhymer, Thom draws a grim picture of the
      awakening of the weavers at the call of the town drum, used for that
      purpose in the smaller burghs, at six o'clock in the bleak and dark
      Northern mornings.

      All this bitterness had reason and fact to excuse it, and it is a wonder
      that such feelings, fermenting in strong minds, did not lead to more
      serious consequences than taproom talk and the formation of Chartist
      clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such surroundings, what was the character and career of Thom himself?
      An active mind led him to the perusal of such books as came in his way,
      and a poetical temperament made him deeply sensitive to the suffering and
      degradation of his condition, while it gave him a stimulus toward the
      fleeting pleasures of dissipation and the glow of sociability and
      popularity among his fellows. He was without the determined energy to rise
      above his condition, which might have succeeded had an exceptional
      strength been allied with his mental gifts, in spite of the forlorn
      circumstances; and he appears to have been, if not content, at least to
      have submitted to be only the popular genius among the workmen of his
      factory, and the leader in the taproom gatherings with his social and
      musical gifts. He wrote songs in imitation of those which he heard, one of
      which, to his great delight, appeared in the poet's corner of an Aberdeen
      newspaper. The story which he tells is that on the morning after the poem
      had been dropped into the mail box, he and a companion waited around the
      door of the publication office, endeavoring in vain to induce some
      charitable purchaser to let them have a peep at the contents of the paper,
      only succeeding at last by crowding the holder of a copy into an entry way
      and examining the columns by force, being absolutely without the penny
      with which to buy one. But this success did not stimulate him with any
      hope of advantage by literature, and he regarded his gift of song writing,
      like his skill with the flute, as simply the means for his own enjoyment
      and the amusement of his associates, his ambition shut in within his own
      little world of squalor and destitution. In appearance he was below the
      middle stature, and with a club foot, so that physical deformity weighed
      upon him, as well as the miserable conditions of his life, and made him
      more sensitive as well as hopeless. For seventeen years he bent over the
      looms in the School Hill factory, and then removed to the small hamlet of
      Newtyle, near Dundee, where a cotton factory had been recently
      established. He now had a family of a wife and four children. In the
      commercial crash of 1836, after he had been there but a short time, the
      factory was suspended, only sufficient work being found for the operatives
      with families to allow them five shillings a week. Five shillings a week
      for six persons meant starvation and creeping death, "an empty armry and a
      cold hearthstone." Thom and his family waited week after week, "hoping
      that times would mend," and with no prospect before them, if they
      abandoned their miserable pittance, but roadside beggary. He gives the
      picture of the scene that drove them to the latter alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Imagine a cold spring forenoon. It is eleven o'clock, but our little
      dwelling shows none of the signs of that time of day. The four children
      were still asleep. There is a bed cover hung before the window to keep all
      within as much like night as possible; and the mother sits beside the beds
      of her children to lull them back to sleep whenever any one shows an
      inclination to awake. For this there is a cause, for our weekly five
      shillings have not come as expected, and the only food in the house
      consists of a handful of oatmeal saved from the supper of last night. Our
      fuel is also exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife and I were conversing in sunken whispers about making an attempt
      to cook the handful of meal, when the youngest child awoke beyond its
      mother's power to hush it again to sleep, and then fell a-whimpering, and
      finally broke out in a steady scream, rendering it impossible any longer
      to keep the rest in a state of unconsciousness. Face after face sprang up,
      each with one consent exclaiming, 'Oh, mither, mither, gie me a piece.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The family took to the road, leaving the key of the miserable tenement
      with the landlord, in the hope of being eventually able to return to a
      home like that. By the sale to a pawnbroker in Dundee of "some relics of
      better days,"&mdash;one can hardly imagine what relics or what days,&mdash;a
      small pack of cheap hawker's goods was procured for the wife, and four
      shillings' worth of books for the husband, to try to sell, but they can
      only have been the flimsiest disguise for the necessity of depending upon
      charity. The tramp began, the mother carrying the youngest child on her
      breast, and often bearing the next youngest also, who was unable to follow
      the weary road the whole distance. Sunset was followed by cold, sour east
      winds and rains. At nine o'clock they arrived at a comfortable farmhouse,
      where they were refused shelter, in the absence of the proprietor. All
      beseeching of the housekeeper was in vain, and the husband returned to the
      family, who had crept closer together, and were all asleep except the
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Willie, Willie, what keepit ye. I'm dootfu'o' Jeanie; is na she
      waesome like? Let's in frae the cauld."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We 've nae wae to gang, lass, whate'er come o' us. Yon folk winnae hae
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      After cowering under a wet mantle in despair for a time, another effort
      was made. The husband wrote a note by the fast fading light, asking for
      shelter, and endeavored to have it taken in at a gentleman's mansion near
      by. It was refused, but a farm laborer was touched by the spectacle of the
      forlorn family, crouching shelterless in the cold and rain, and took them
      to a neighboring farmhouse, where they were warmed and fed in the
      servants' quarters, and put to rest in beds of straw and bagging in an
      outhouse. Between three and four o'clock the father was wakened by the
      deadly scream of the mother, who had wakened to find her infant dead by
      her side, its little life having been worn out by the cold, hunger, and
      fatigue of the previous day. Amid the wailing of the children, and in the
      benumbing anguish of the blow, the most vivid remembrance of that moment
      to the father was the watching of the wheeling and fluttering of a colony
      of swallows, their fellow-lodgers, who had been awakened by the outcries.

      Kind hands assisted in burying the child in the country graveyard, and the
      tramp was renewed. The poor goods and books would not sell, and no work
      was to be found, if, indeed, it was more than hopelessly looked for. The
      people, mostly the poor, "gave bits of bread for the poor bairnies," and
      shelter was found after nightfall in the outhouses of farms, experience
      having taught them that it was useless to apply for lodgings during
      daylight. They met and shared the fortunes of many "gangrel-bodies," some
      poor and respectable like themselves, and others professional mendicants
      and wandering ne'er-do-wells to whom beggary was the accustomed mode of
      livelihood, and many tragedies of life in its last extremity like their
      own passed under their eyes. One evening, in a gathering of people in the
      street of the village of Errol, he heard a man of grave countenance and
      respectable appearance singing, and with that note of despair in his voice
      which touched his heart with the sympathy like that which made Goldsmith
      rush from the lighted room to relieve the poor beggarwoman singing under
      the window. That night in their lodging there was a young woman rocking a
      corpse-like infant, whose wailing would not be stilled. Then the man who
      had been singing entered, and bent over the dying child:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have wearied sadly for your coming, James," said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It 's so dark out by the nicht," replied the man, "I only found out this
      door by our wean greetin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child died during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length in the town of Methven, without even the necessary sixpence,
      preliminary to untieing the shoes in a tramp lodging house, an idea struck
      Thom that he might make use of his flute to avoid absolute mendicancy.
      Telling his wife to take the flute from their budget, and to accompany
      him, he went out into the streets. The story can be told only in his own
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We found ourselves in a beautiful green lane, fairly out of town, and
      opposite a genteel-looking house, at the windows of which sat several
      well-dressed people. I think that it might be our bewilderment that
      attracted their notice&mdash;perhaps not favorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A quarter of an hour longer,' said I, 4 and it will be darker. Let us
      walk out a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun had been down a good while and the gloamin' was lovely. In spite
      of everything I felt a momentary reprieve. I dipped my dry flute in a
      little brook and began to play. It rang sweetly amongst the trees. I moved
      on and on, still playing, and still facing the town. The Flowers of the
      Forest brought me before the house, lately mentioned. My music raised one
      window after another, and in less than ten minutes put me in possession of
      three shillings ninepence of good British money. I sent the mother home
      with this treasure, and directed her to send the little girl to me. It was
      by this time nearly dark. Every one says, 'Things just need a beginning.'
      I have had a beginning and a very good one, too. I had also a turn for
      strathspeys, and there appeared to be a run on them. By this time I was
      nearing the middle of the town. When I finally made my way, and retired to
      my lodging, it was with five shillings and some pence in addition to what
      was given us. My little girl got a beautiful shawl and some articles of
      wearing apparel."
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed up his playing by writing an ode to his flute, which he got
      printed on slips, and sent in to the houses before which he appeared, with
      satisfactory results in donations, in one instance receiving the
      magnificent reward of half a guinea. But, as he says, it was but "beggar's
      wark," and he was glad to return to his weaving when times got a little
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a year at the loom in Aberdeen, he had an opportunity to work as a
      journeyman for a weaver, who took in custom work, in the little town of
      Inverury in the district bordering on Mar. Here, after nine months'
      residence, his wife, his "faithful Jeanie," died in child-bed, leaving him
      with three children, the daughter a herd lassie at a lonely farm at some
      distance. In January, 1841, being then more than forty years of age, and
      never before having attempted to find a market for his verse, the notion
      occurred to him, in despair at the dullness of work, to send a poem,
      entitled The Blind Boy's Pranks, to the Aberdeen Journal. It was prefaced
      by a note, signed "A Serf," and declaring that the writer was compelled to
      weave fourteen hours out of the four and twenty. After some time, and
      while he was engaged in packing the few clothes of himself and children in
      order to seek shelter at the Aberdeen House of Refuge, he received a
      letter, with encouraging words, from the editor, and inclosing half a
      guinea. The poem was widely copied into the Scottish newspapers, and
      attracted very favorable attention. Among its admirers was a Mr. Gordon of
      Knockespock, an Aberdeenshire laird, who made inquiries about the author
      and interested himself in his welfare. It is difficult to understand the
      sudden and extraordinary popularity of this poem, which is by no means of
      commanding merit, but the story of
    </p>
    <p>
      Thom's life became known and he was treated as a literary phenomenon. He
      was taken on a holiday trip to London by Mr. Gordon, and introduced to the
      leaders of the Scottish colony there, who made much of him, and on his
      return he was given a public dinner in Aberdeen. Demands for his verses
      came upon him from various periodicals, and he was enabled to establish a
      custom weaving shop in Inverury for himself. The next three years, while
      he was thus engaged, were the happiest and the only comfortable ones of
      his life. He refused other offers of employment, and asked no patronage
      except the purchase of his home-made clothes. He was the head of a little
      circle of local bards, who looked up to him, and sought his critical
      approval and patronage for their verses. His fame was increasing and
      reached a national knowledge in the publication of the volume of his
      poems, in 1844, by a leading London firm. In an evil hour he was persuaded
      to give up his business of weaving and establish himself in London as an
      agent for the sale of weaver's cloth. He was without business knowledge or
      business habits, lived recklessly and extravagantly, keeping an open house
      for Chartist agitators and wandering Scottish poets. His inspiration
      failed him; he wrote little or nothing, and lost his head completely in
      the whirl of excitement and social dissipation. After three years of this,
      what he called his "Hospital" was closed by a sheriff's sale of his
      furniture, and he returned to Scotland by the aid of a subscription from
      his friends and a grant from the Literary Fund. He settled at Hawkhill,
      near Dundee, but his health was broken, and his habits of industry
      destroyed, and he lived recklessly and wretchedly, until death relieved
      him soon after, in February, 1848. With one fitful gleam of prosperity
      William Thom's life of half a century had been passed in such want and
      abject misery as falls to the lot of few mortals, and amid a squalor and
      degradation of surroundings to which the country poverty of Burns and
      Hogg, in healthy air and in touch with the sweetness and majesty of
      nature, was rich and fortunate. One is as surprised and almost shocked to
      find the flowers of genuine poetry blooming in such a life, as to see a
      pot of violets growing amid the whirling dust and rattling noise of a
      weaving factory or in the window of a dingy whiskey shop. That his life
      was not worse than it was under the influences which affected it, is no
      less wonderful. "To us," he says, "virtues were known only by their
      shadows," and that sentence tells all the hopeless misery of an existence
      in which squalor and unremitting toil were relieved only by the fitful
      gleams of stupefying indulgence, and in which an ever-pressing want meant
      the deprivation not only of the comforts, but of the necessities of life.
      That such a page of human history should be possible and common in the
      record of a civilized society is more appalling than the devastation of
      war, or the crimes of natural malignity, and we must wonder how any spark
      of virtue or genius survived it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest in the life of a man who has written poetry does not make its
      value. It may add an element of curiosity to biographical history, but it
      is upon its own inherent quality that it must depend for consideration and
      remembrance. Extraordinary circumstances in the life and character of the
      writer may lend an additional interest to his poetry, and cause it to be
      studied more attentively from a psychological point of view, but it must
      first be genuine poetry, and the questions of the personality and
      circumstances of its author are subordinate ones. Other thieves and
      blackguards like Francis Villon have doubtless written verses in the
      intervals of their debauches, and other ploughmen like Burns and other
      weavers like Thom have unquestionably done so under equally difficult and
      depressing conditions, but that fact has not kept their poetry alive or
      their names in remembrance. There were contemporaries of Thom, fishermen,
      turf-cutters, handicraftsmen, and publicans, whose names are preserved in
      local history and who even published forgotten volumes, who wrote verses
      under circumstances no less extraordinary than his own, but the world has
      taken no note of them, and is not called upon to do so. The question in
      regard to William Thom, as to all other poets, is as to what contribution,
      small or great, he made to the stock of genuine poetry in form,
      expression, and essence, fitting it to stand alone and to speak with a
      living voice to the emotions of the world, aside from any pathos or
      interest connected with its production. Poetry of this kind in the work of
      William Thom is very small in quantity. He published but a single volume,
      in which the verse comprises scarcely more than a hundred pages, and much
      the greater portion of this is artificial in conception and imperfect in
      form and expression. Like many uneducated authors, he endeavored to
      imitate the writers of polite literature, who seemed to him models of
      taste and fancy, although he had the native good judgment and national
      feeling to confine himself to the Scottish dialect, and the greater
      proportion of his verses have this weakness of imitation, or were called
      forth by special occasions and for a local audience. The poems entitled
      The Blind Boy's Pranks, which first attracted attention, are fanciful
      descriptions of the doings of Cupid, who is not more at home on the cold
      streams and heathery hills of the north of Scotland than on the head of an
      Italian image seller in the smoke and grime of London, and has no
      acquaintance with the sturdy Scotch lassies with whom he is supposed to
      play tricks. The native fairies with which Hogg peopled the raths and
      mounds of Ettrick do not appear in Thom's verses..When he wrote of what
      must have appealed most strongly to his heart and knowledge, the wrongs
      and sufferings of his fellow operatives, he was, as has been said, greatly
      influenced by the perfervid and declamatory style of Ebenezer Elliot, and
      weakened the force of his descriptions by exaggeration and savage
      invective. His songs were for the most part in the vein of the current
      Scottish lyric poetry, and, although not without grace and felicity of
      expression, rarely above the limits of conventionality and imitation. The
      song by which he is most widely known, and which appears in all the
      collections of Scottish poetry, The Mitherless Bairn, owes its vogue to
      its simple pathos, appealing to the popular emotions rather than to its
      quality as poetry. There are forcible and felicitous lines scattered
      through Thom's poetry, in which the language and melody combine to render
      the thought or sentiment with original power, and touches of description
      which show the sensitive eye illumined by the feeling heart, as this of
      the winter-beaten birds:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like beildless birdies, when they ca'
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and the pervading genuineness of a deep feeling, even if imperfectly
      expressed. There was the gloaming of a "waesome light" about his spirit,
      which shone through his uncertain gifts of utterance, although its power
      would not have been enough to have preserved his poetry in remembrance,
      except for two lyrics which reach the very highest level of Scottish song
      in their completeness and finish of construction, as well as in their
      simplicity and power. It may be believed from the crudity and imperfection
      of Thom's other verses that this supreme felicity was accidental, the
      perfect rapture of some occasional song of a thrush breaking out by its
      own inspiration after many careless warblings, rather than the deliberate
      effort of trained skill, and perhaps with little appreciation of their
      success. Every poet has his moments of supreme success when he reaches
      beyond his ordinary powers, and execution attains to the level of
      inspiration, but in most it is seen to be the culmination of trained skill
      reached by long labor and painstaking effort. There is little, however, in
      Thom's verse to lead to the expectation of such a flowering of perfect
      form and expression, and the impression is strong that they are accidental
      felicities. But, however produced, they give him an indisputable title to
      a place beside the highest of the Scottish song writers, and will live by
      their innate grace and power and feeling, when the rest of his work is
      forgotten, and the record of his strange and unfortunate life swallowed up
      in oblivion. This is the first one of them, grown from the banks of the
      Ythan, a little stream near Inverury, where Thom wandered some evening
      after the day's benumbing labor at the loom:&mdash;

    <h2>
      FOLK-SONGS OF LOWER BRITTANY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he publication in
      1859 of Count Hersart de Villemarqué's Barzaz Breiz, or collection of
      ancient Breton ballads and folk-songs, excited almost as much interest in
      the literary world as Bishop Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry a
      century earlier, if not reaching to the point of that evoked by
      Macpherson's Ossian. The interest was historical and ethnological as well
      as literary. Here were historical ballads, full of fire and passion and
      pathos, dealing not alone with such comparatively recent and recognized
      historic figures as Bernard du Guesclin and Jean de Montfort, but dating
      back to the sixth century and earlier, having for definite characters
      Merlin and King Arthur, and containing distinct traces of Druidic and
      bardic influence, which had been preserved, not in manuscript, as were the
      remains of Celtic poetry in Wales and Ireland, but by oral tradition and
      as a part of the still living folk-poetry of the people. It was no wonder
      that great interest was excited by the apparent evidence that a people
      living in the midst of European civilization had preserved an unbroken
      tradition of popular poetry for thirteen centuries, with strong traces of
      heathen influence extending back much farther, in almost absolute purity
      of language and definite historic characterization, and it was regarded
      from an ethnologic point of view as of hardly less importance than the
      discoveries of the remains of the Lake dwellers and other tokens of the
      existence of prehistoric man. Apparent credibility was given to the
      authenticity of the collection by the fact that the Breton people had
      preserved their language in its native condition and form, and by their
      customs, dress, and manner of life were marked off from the rest of the
      French people by a distinct line, which showed the strength, originality,
      and persistence of the race. It was known that they retained the original
      characteristics of the Celtic race, its fervency of religious faith, its
      melancholy, its sensitiveness to the mysterious influences of nature, its
      passion and its loyalty, and that many of its customs and habits of life
      were distinct survivals of mediævalism, and utterly anomalous to the
      spirit of modern civilization. It was therefore not thought impossible, if
      extraordinary, that the ancient ballads should have been preserved in
      their original purity, and the compositions of the ancient bards and
      minstrels still remain to be collected from the lips of the wandering
      mendicant singers, who gathered audiences about them at Fairs and Pardons,
      or lightened the gloom of the winter evenings in the farm kitchens with
      song and legend. The character of the ballads in Villemarque's collection
      was singularly well adapted to produce this belief. They were simple in
      construction, impregnated with the characteristics of the people, their
      faith, their loyalty, their purity and gravity of thought, their
      subjection to the influence of the supernatural, and their devoted
      patriotism, and, aside from their genuine strength and elevation as
      poetry, were a faithful reflection of the thoughts and habits of their
      people, and of the authentic facts of their history. There were no signs
      of such incongruous piecing of the thoughts of a later civilization and
      the style of a later literature upon an ancient substance, as were visible
      in Bishop Percy's emendations and completions of the English and Scottish
      ballads, but they were complete and homogeneous in the very spirit and
      language of ancient poetry. As a consequence, they were not only accepted
      as genuine and authentic, but there was an immense interest created in the
      study and revival of the Breton language and literature, and an
      appreciation of the characteristics and influence of the Celtic race in
      France, which has continued and deepened to the present time. An academy
      was founded, with M. de Villemarqué for its president, and assemblies of
      bards and scholars were held like the Welsh Eistedfodds, and there was a
      temporary Breton rage like that for the Highland Scotch under the
      influence of the Waverley novels, although no ruler of France went so far
      as to appear in the Breton hat and waistcoat, as George the Fourth did in
      the Highland kilt during his visit to Edinburgh. Several translations of
      the ballads of the Barzaz Breiz appeared in German, and Mr. Tom Taylor
      rendered them into English, in a version singularly compounded of archaic
      phraseology and stage rhetoric. But the later investigation of careful and
      conscientious collectors of Breton folkpoetry, like M. F. M. Luzel and
      others, has destroyed the faith in the authenticity of M. Yillemarqué's
      ballads almost as completely as in that of Macpherson's Ossian. They are
      not to be found in existence among the present singers or the survivors of
      the generation from whom M. Villemarqué professed to have gathered them,
      except in a very mutilated form, and with most of their flowers of poetry
      ruthlessly swept away. Experiments have been tried at gatherings of the
      most famous depositories of folk-poetry and the most accomplished singers,
      by repeating the ballads of the Barzaz Breiz to them, but they have in all
      cases either professed total ignorance, or insisted upon such amendments
      as deprived them of all but the faintest resemblance; while the only
      occasions in which they have been heard sung by the peasantry have been
      traced to the scattered leaves of the book itself. A hot literary
      controversy has been waged over the authenticity of M. Villemarqué's
      ballads, but the best opinion has settled into the belief that they are
      fabrications and reconstructions from fragments not more authentic and
      genuine than those which were the basis of Macpherson's Ossian or
      Chatterton's poems of Rowley, although M. Villemarqué was as thoroughly
      possessed with the spirit of Breton poetry, and as saturated with the
      knowledge of Breton history, as Sir Walter Scott was with Scottish poetry
      and Scottish history, and in one sense they were as genuine as the ballads
      of The Baron of Smalholme and Thomas the Rhymer. But the idea that the
      contemporary poems relating to Merlin and King Arthur, and even those of
      the exploits of Du Guesclin and The Combat of the Thirty, had been
      preserved in faithful and uncorrupted condition by oral tradition, and
      were still a portion of the folk-songs of the Breton peasantry, to say
      nothing of the survival of Druidic poetry and tradition in a distinct
      form, attractive as it is to the historic imagination, must be given up,
      like the belief in the survival of the epic of Fingal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not do to expect too much from folkpoetry in the way of the
      perpetuation of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the remains of prehistoric people buried in geologic strata, it has
      been subject to the inevitable destruction of natural forces and to the
      attrition of time, and only remains like the fragments of implements and
      the piles of kitchen middens, from which careful study can extract the
      evidences of former existence and habits. It is only when ancient poetry
      has been committed to writing, like the poems of Homer and the
      Scandinavian sagas, that it can be preserved in anything like a complete
      state; and while there is a singular tenacity in popular poetry, it cannot
      endure for centuries by oral tradition alone, however secluded the people
      or however strong their national and poetic spirit. Sir Walter Scott was
      only just in time to save the Border ballads of the previous two
      centuries, and the usual duration of popular ballads in anything but an
      indistinct and fragmentary condition is even less. But, although the
      authenticity of the ballads of the Barzaz Breiz is discredited, it cannot
      be said that there is no genuine and valuable Breton folk-song. On the
      contrary, it exists in very great quantity and of a high quality, not only
      as poetry, but as illustrating the character and history of the people.
      The Breton race is not only a profoundly poetical one, by its pensive,
      mystic, and deeply religious character, but by its secluded condition
      apart from the currents of modern education, and its occupations in the
      gloomy, wind-swept, and rain-beaten fields and on the mysterious and
      terrifying seas, is particularly subject to the influences which make
      folk-song a part of its life and the natural expression of its thoughts
      and emotions. Nor is its folk-poetry entirely without value in the
      strictly historical sense, although anything like absolute accuracy or the
      definite remains of contemporary historic verse are not to be expected. As
      in the extant folk-lore of other nations, the roots run far back, and
      evidences of the traditions and customs of former ages survive in a
      fragmentary and altered state, in which may be traced the tokens of the
      existence of the race in the earliest dawn of history and even before any
      known records. Thus, if there are no authentic poems of the time of Merlin
      and King Arthur in the Breton folk-songs of the present day, their names
      and traditions survive; and, if the school culture of the Druids does not
      survive in the poems of numeral questions on the characters and events of
      the Bible, as imagined or invented by M. Villemarqué, no less fragments of
      their customs and worship remain in the habits and traditions of the
      people in and outside of their religious ritual, and are perpetuated in
      their folk-songs, if with as little definite knowledge as of the rites
      once performed at the feet of the dolmens or in the temple of Karnac. The
      fairies, and the dwarfs, and the spirits of the sea and air still survive,
      and are dreaded or invoked in the same spirit, if with less fervency than
      the saints and powers of the Church. Thus M. Paul Sebillot, in his Contes
      des Marins, gathered in Upper Brittany, tells that the sailors shake their
      fists at and threaten with their knives an unfavorable wind, and there are
      numerous actual customs as well as traditions among the Breton people
      which are evident survivals from heathen ages, while the rites of the
      Church itself have many traces of the adoption of forms of nature worship.
      This element of the supernatural, like the traditions of actual history,
      is fading away in Brittany as in all other countries, but enough remains
      to throw a strong light on the ancient customs, as well as the fundamental
      character of the race, and to inform its folk-poetry with this element to
      a degree which that of few modern nations possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest of modern folk-poetry is, however, mainly in quality as
      poetry, its expression with eloquence and feeling of the emotions of the
      human heart, and the representation which it gives of the quality of the
      mind, the temperament, the degree of intelligence, and the habits and
      customs of the people who produced it. In this view the two latest volumes
      of the collection of Breton folksongs by F. M. Luzel, Sonniou Breiz-Izel
      (Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emile Bouillon, 1890), are particularly interesting. His two previous
      volumes, Gwerzion Breiz-Izel, were devoted to the fantastic, supernatural,
      and tragic ballads which held a place by the side of the fabulous tales in
      the minds of the people, were derived from the remote past, and had little
      connection with the life of to-day. On the contrary, the Sonniou, for
      which songs is the somewhat imperfect equivalent in English, are the
      immediate interpretation of their thoughts and emotions, the transcripts
      of their present life, and its events, sung and told by living poets, or
      those who have lived within a time to make them a part of the present
      people. They include the songs which are sung by the cradles to drowsing
      infants, the hopes and sorrows of love, the joyous welcomes to weddings,
      the homely pains of married life, and the sorrows for the common lot of
      death, the chants of religious faith and worship, the charms against
      diseases, the accompaniments of labor and the peculiarities of trade and
      occupation, the homely reflections on the conduct of life, and the rustic
      humor and satire, and, in short, all the thoughts and events, which mark
      the daily life of the people. Of their absolute genuineness there can be
      no question. They have all the internal evidence in their construction and
      language, the simplicity and abruptness of thought, the imperfection of
      utterance combined with untaught eloquence and strength, the occasional
      vulgarity by the side of an equally great delicacy, the simple and
      powerful melody, and all the characteristics of popular poetry, which are
      as unmistakable as the perfumes of the flowers of the field. Their
      collection has been the work of forty-five years, in which M. Luzel has
      indefatigably traversed the provinces of Lower Brittany, visiting the
      solitary huts of the sabot makers and hemp-weavers, colloquing with
      wandering beggars, listening to the songs and stories at the kitchen
      firesides of lonely farms in winter, gathering the singers at the Fair
      around him in the tap-rooms, taking down the songs of nursing mothers, the
      sailors on shipboard and the soldiers in the barracks, the shepherds on
      the plains and the laborers in the fields, and, in short, gathering every
      form of verse which is the expression of the popular thoughts and
      emotions. They are naturally of less purely literary merit than the
      ballads of the Barzaz Breiz, which are carefully arranged, trimmed, and
      decorated for poetical effect. It is always a sign for suspicion when
      folk-poetry is too good. The picturesque garments of the Breton peasantry
      must show the signs of actual wear and even the stains of grease and dirt,
      if they are to have the genuine effect, and when they are of too fine
      material, too carefully arranged, and shining and spotless, the impression
      is that they are simply stage costumes drawn from the theatrical wardrobe.
      Even the beggar with his rags too artistically draped suggests the
      painter's model. So there must be the element of reality in their defects
      before the folk-songs can be accepted as really genuine, and it adds a
      power and even a literary effect to them, which in its peculiar flavor the
      most accomplished literary art cannot produce. We seem to hear the speech
      of living men, to feel the thoughts of simple hearts through the imperfect
      utterance, and to experience all the flavor of actual and homely life. The
      pieces in the Sonniou collected by M. Luzel have all this quality. They
      have the coarse material and the patches of garments actually worn, and
      their charm is due to their native picturesqueness and originality. There
      is no false sentiment, however deep the feeling, and the homely thoughts
      are expressed in homely phrases, with natural imagery drawn from the
      aspect of nature about them and their avocations in life. Their standard
      of conventionality in speech differs from that of polite society, and
      there are words and phrases which smack of a coarse and natural life, but
      they are, nevertheless, singularly pure in thought, and show the soundness
      and honesty of the Breton character, as well as its tenderness and warmth
      of affection. If not great refinement, there is great depth of feeling,
      and actual vulgarity of thought is as rare as immoral suggestion, even in
      the rude satires and humorous narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of all folk-song is in the cooing melodies which the mothers
      chant by the inspiration of nature by the cradles of their drowsing
      infants, and in which the affections of their hearts take an articulate
      form as naturally as the songs of birds. The <i>berceuses</i>, or cradle
      songs, of the Breton peasantry have all the elements of deep feeling and
      childish simplicity of expression which characterize the voice of
      motherhood in every clime and every station in life, and unite the queen
      and the peasant in a common bond. The same lovely and touching images
      suggest themselves, and the same simple and soothing melody flows
      naturally from the lips. This Breton cradle song might find its parallel
      in thought and language in many nations:&mdash;

      Next to cradle songs, the creations of motherly affection, come the songs
      of youthful passion, when the instinct of love wakes in the hearts of the
      young man and the maid; and they sing, also, as naturally and simply as
      birds do in pairing time. There is often a touching inconsequence in these
      simple strains, a transcript of nature as it speaks to the heart, and
      finds almost inarticulate utterance in emotions of joy and sorrow, which

      THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE.
    </h2>
    <p class="indent5">
      Sing, sing, nightingale, it is early you are singing.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Not earlier than you, young man. Hunting are you going?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Good luck to you, little comrade. I am not going a-hunt
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ing.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I am on my way to Kerlosquet, where my love is dwelling.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The nightingale then asked him, being a curious gossip,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There are many houses at Kerlosquet, to which one are you
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      going?

    <p class="indent5">
      The young man answered her in a tone of humor,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Good luck to you, little comrade, I am not at confession.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In a moment after he saw his mistress coming;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      By her color and her looks he saw that she was ailing.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Anxiously he asked her, feeling for her sadness,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Are you sick at heart, or sick in your spirit?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And she answered, with a little smile so gracious,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I am not subject to sickness, no, by the mercy of Jesus.

      The most numerous producers of love songs in the Breton folk-poetry are
      the <i>cloer</i>, or young theological students, to whose title the
      English word clerk, as it was understood in the time of Chaucer, is the
      nearest equivalent. These young men, mostly the sons of peasants or
      persons in humble circumstances, are destined for the priesthood, for
      which they have manifested a vocation by their special intellectual
      brightness or devotional temperament. They are naturally the pride and
      hope of their families, to whom the office of priest is a position of
      worldly advancement and religious reverence, and the ballads tell touching
      tales of sacrifices by poor parents to enable their son to pursue his
      studies. They are sent to the seminaries attached to the abbeys in the
      various cathedral towns, from which they return in the vacation to mingle
      with the life of the people. Although destined for the priesthood, the
      instinct of youthful passion breaks out, as they meet the young maidens of
      the neighborhood in the fields or at the village fêtes and gatherings, and
      there are struggles of love and longing, which sometimes end peacefully in
      the surrender of the affection to the demands of the priestly vow,
      sometimes in the tragedy of broken hearts and a double devotion to
      religious celibacy, and sometimes, under the influence of a stronger
      passion, in the renunciation of the priesthood and marriage with the
      object of affection. These young clerks are, naturally, objects of great
      attraction to the young maidens by the contrast of their superior manners
      and education to the duller and coarser young men of the peasant class,
      and this attraction results in many dramas of love, not to mention the
      deeper tragedies of blighted passions and ruined lives. From their
      superior intellectual activity and education the young clerks are the most
      fertile and eloquent of the folk-poets, and by far the greater number of
      the love songs in the Sonniou are their production, and relate to the
      condition in which their affections are bound and limited. Their songs are
      genuine folk-poetry in their simplicity and strength of expression, except
      in the few instances where sophomoric pedantry overloads them with
      mythologie terms and academic phrases, and they often express a deep
      feeling with simple and natural eloquence. In The Ditty of Love the young
      girl appeals to the clerk to abandon the priesthood, since there are
      enough priests in the country, and expect the blessing of God in marrying
      the one who loves him, and then resigns herself to the consolation they
      will have in hearing the bells of each other's convents and their voices
      raised in psalm:&mdash;

      The amatory folk-songs of Brittany have their peculiar images and phrases,
      like those of all other countries, and which are repeated without
      variation as almost essential characteristics. The reader of Scottish
      ballads knows how invariably the recipient of a letter first smiles and
      then has his eyes blinded by tears, and recalls the constant repetition of
      familiar images and descriptions. So in the Breton folk-songs the lover
      constantly declares that he has worn out three pairs of sabots in coming
      to see her without being able to find out her thought, and that he has
      watched in the wind and rain through the night with no consolation but the
      sound of her soft breathing through the key-hole of the door; to which the
      cruel or coquettish damsel replies that she has no objection to tell him
      her thought, which is that he should buy a new pair of shoes, or that he
      should take himself home as soon as possible. The piece entitled In the
      White Cabin at the Foot of the Mountain is a characteristic specimen of
      these songs, whose effect of simplicity can only be retained by an
      absolutely literal translation: &mdash;

      Another form of the love song than the melancholy apostrophe to the
      mistress, and the simple moralizing which accompanies it, is the gay
      chant, which was composed to the dance measures played by the <i>biniou</i>
      and the <i>bombarde</i> at the village fêtes, and which was sung in accord
      with them. On these occasions, which were chiefly the Pardons, or
      gatherings to celebrate the days of the Patron Saints, when the religious
      exercises are concluded, the young men engage in athletic competition,
      wrestling and jumping for prizes under the eyes of their sweethearts, and
      the festivities wind up with dancing on the green, and the scene is as gay
      as if it had no connection with religion. Every Breton story teller, and
      every writer on the life and customs of Brittany, has delighted to depict
      these scenes, which are the rendezvous of youthful lovers and the
      embodiment of vigorous and healthy gayety, with all the picturesqueness of
      country life and color. The element of these dance songs is their lively
      and strongly accented melody to accompany the dancing air and illustrate
      the movements, as in the following specimen:&mdash;

      It might be expected that in a country so much under the influence of the
      sea, and in which so large a proportion of the inhabitants are sailors,
      fishers on the stormy and dangerous coast or in the distant waters of
      Newfoundland and Iceland, there would be a large number of sea songs. The
      folk-lore of Brittany is particularly rich in stories and legends of the
      sea, composed by the fishermen to while away the long hours of the passage
      to Newfoundland or the nightwatches in the misty seas of Iceland; or
      embodying the mysterious and superstitious terrors of the fishermen of the
      coast in the face of storms and foaming reefs; and the impress of
      supernatural power in the ocean and the storm is very strong upon the
      imaginations of the Breton people. But the sailors themselves, like the
      laborers in the fields, do not seem to have the inspiration and poetical
      gift to put their thoughts into song. M. Luzel has been able to collect
      but a comparatively few of genuine sailor songs, and these are mostly
      tavern choruses or rude and commonplace chants, with but very little of
      the salt of the seas and the voice of the breeze in them. The women
      sometimes chant at the spinning-wheel songs of warning against the dangers
      and perils of becoming a sailor's wife, of which the following is an
      example:&mdash;

      The Breton women, who spend hours at the spinning-wheel, as in all other
      countries, accompany the monotonous and musical drone with long chants,
      that hypnotize the sense of labor, which are often merely improvisations
      with as little sense and meaning as the lullabies for infants. But here is
      one into which the old spinner puts the thoughts of her willingness to
      make sacrifice of her all in order that her son might be educated as a
      priest, and her hopes of reward from his filial piety. The soothing and
      monotonous melody is necessarily lost in the translation.

      One of the most notable and singular features in Breton folk-poetry is the
      feeling displayed toward animals. Almost human attributes of wisdom and
      affection are bestowed upon them, and, unlike many primitive races, the
      Breton peasantry have a great tenderness toward the dumb companions of
      their labors. When they kill them it is from necessity, and with a genuine
      sensibility for their sufferings, which may have its ancient root in a
      tradition of animal worship, such as led the North American Indian to
      apologize to the bear, whom he was killing with his arrows. At any rate it
      is a very creditable feeling, and adds to the respect and liking which the
      Breton character inspires, that there should be this tenderness for the
      old horse, who has ploughed the fields and borne burdens until his
      strength is spent; for the old goat, who has given milk for the children;
      and even for the pig, who has inhabited the pen by the cabin. In the
      folk-songs this feeling is represented by various pieces of verse, giving
      the last wills and testaments of old animals, who bequeath, sometimes in a
      spirit of humor, and sometimes with affectionate tenderness, portions of
      their bodies and qualities of their spirits to their human friends and
      companions. There is thus the testament of the goat, the old sow, and the
      old mare. The latter displays a touching feeling, and the impression of
      quaint absurdity gives way to a more tender emotion and that touch of
      pathos which is evoked by all animal affection and animal suffering.

      As has been said, the chief value of folk-song is in its genuineness, in
      the accuracy with which it reflects not only the emotions, but the habits
      and customs of the people, so that their peculiar life becomes visible
      before our eyes. There is an indefinable charm, not only in the impression
      of reality, but in the very rudeness and imperfection of the speech, which
      gives an effect beyond literary art, when deep emotion or domestic pathos
      are seen through it. We seem to get nearer the primitive heart of mankind
      than under the effect of the most accomplished literary skill, and there
      are awakened the homely and tender feelings which lie deep within our
      nature. The genuine fairy tale created by the vivid and credulous
      imagination of the uncultivated mind, and the genuine folk-song, the
      outburst of simple and natural emotion, take a hold upon even the most
      cultivated intellects as the highest literary art fails to do. The
      folk-songs of Brittany have this charm as well as their own peculiar
      provincial flavor; and the very crudeness and imperfection of the Sonniou
      in M. Luzel's collection have more power than all the elaborate poetry and
      picturesqueness of M. Yillemarque's Celtic fabrications.

    <h2>
      THE FOLK-SONGS OF POITOU.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile there is much
      that is common in the folk-songs of all the provinces of France, the same
      stories and the same turns of expression, showing, if not a common origin,
      a very wide and thorough intercommunication,&mdash;as, for instance, in
      the beautiful and pathetic ballad of Jean Renaud, which is found almost
      everywhere in slightly differing variants,&mdash;each section has its own
      local peculiarities illustrating the temperament and the origin of the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that there is a strongly marked note of difference
      between the melancholy and finely sensitive songs of the people of
      Brittany and the gay and joyous chants and ballads of those of Gascony and
      Provence. It would be inevitable from the widely different natures of the
      two people, and their origin from distinct and strongly divergent native
      stocks. But this distinction goes further, and marked shades of difference
      in feeling and sentiment may be found in the character and temperament of
      the folk-songs and music of the inhabitants of the same province, who are
      of common origin and consanguinity, with the same native language, and the
      same habits and customs. This is due in a great measure to a difference in
      their surroundings, and the influence of external nature, whether gay or
      morose, fertile or barren, upon the minds and characters of the people.
      Thus in his splendid collection of the Chants and Chansons Populaires des
      Provinces de l'Ouest, M. Jerome Burgeaud tells us that the plaintive and
      melancholy airs of the inhabitants of the deep woods and heavy marshes of
      La Vendee become gay and cheerful in Poitou, and sparkle with brilliant
      mirth in Saintonge and the Angumois, without changing their notes or form,
      simply from the difference in the scenery and its influence upon the
      spirits of the people. The ancient Poitou, comprising the upper portion of
      the region between the Loire and Garonne, is full of smiling and rich
      fields, where the grapes burgeon in deep black clusters, and the yellow
      wheat-ears hang heavy and full, and the warm sun and the savory air fill
      the blood of the people with lightness and gayety. They are not so
      ebullient and joyous, it may be, as the inhabitants of the still warmer
      and more smiling regions of Gascony and Languedoc, but the contrast is
      very marked between them and their northern neighbors, whose very mirth
      has a melancholy tinge, and in whom even drunkenness is a protest against
      sorrow rather than the natural extravagance of light-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Poitevin peasant is naturally gay, and his light-heartedness is
      manifested in the great number, as well as in the good humor and
      cheerfulness, of his folk-songs. Of course the common sorrows of mankind
      weigh upon him; he feels the stings of poverty and the pains and
      sordidness of labor; the conscription tears him from his home and his
      beloved; and he experiences the tragedies of love and death. These things
      stir his mind and find a place in his folk-songs, but the prevailing
      spirit which governs his expression in music and song is not of melancholy
      brooding and sorrow, like that of his Celtic neighbors, but gayety and
      joyousness. He finds the smiling world a pleasant place to live in; his
      love is the natural and happy ebullition of his warm temperament; and his
      experiences of life are cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gayety of the Poitevin temperament finds its expression in the immense
      number of "rounds" as they are called in English, which give the vocal
      measure and accompaniment to the vigorous and joyous dances. The youths
      and the maidens, when they meet at the rustic gatherings, or even in the
      intervals of labor in the fields, join hands by a natural instinct, and
      improvise a dance to the rhythm of their own voices, and the "rounds"
      which they sing, although often mere nonsense, or at least without a
      consecutive meaning, have a note of gayety and an ebullition of
      joyousness, which is inimitable, as thus:&mdash;

      All these, like the ancient choruses with which the Greek maidens
      accompanied their dances of "woven paces and waving hands," with or
      without the note of a primitive reed to accent the melody, are reproduced
      in the grosser spirit of the laboring peasant, but equally instinctive
      with life and gayety, and the natural expression of youthful existence in
      the open air and under balmy skies.

      One of the most characteristic features of the Poitevin peasant is his
      cunning, his fondness for rustic ruses, and the sharp repartee or trick,
      which puts to shame the person of a station above his own. The heroines of
      many of his favorite ballads and songs are endowed with this quality, and
      he chuckles with a hearty zest at the simple wit with which the shrewd
      shepherdess puts down the amorous gallant learned in the schools, or
      escapes the dangerous importunity of a gentleman on the highway or a
      seignorial hunter in the fields. The folksongs of Poitou are full of such
      examples, and M. Bugeaud, and M. Leon Pineau, who has followed him in
      gleaning in the same field (Le Folk-Lore du Poitou), have given a number
      of specimens. The following shows what simple repartee appeals to the
      rustic sense of humor:&mdash;

      One of the favorite ruses is that by which the shepherd maid induces the
      gallant to let her go, on some frivolous excuse and a promise to return,
      and then mocks him for his credulity. A similar jest, with the proverb
      that when you hold a quail in hand you should pluck it, is very common in
      French folk-song, as, indeed, in that of all nations. This is one of the
      Poitevin versions:&mdash;

      THE SHEPHERDESS AND THE GENTLEMAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="indent5">
      It was a gentleman returning from the army,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Upon the road he met a shepherd maid;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He dismounted quickly, and went to sit beside her.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Cunning was the maid, and wept as if afraid.

      "Have mercy, gentleman, you 'll spoil my fine, white cap,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I 'll go and put it off, and come back quite soon."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The gallant gentleman found the time quite tedious,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The maiden did not come; he whistled a blank tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "John, my little John, go and tell the maiden

    <p class="indent5">
      "Good fortune it is to me that I have got away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      By the grace of God I have no shame to weep."

    <p class="indent5">
      "Little John returned to where his master waited,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Whistling a blank tune beneath the willow tree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Alas, my master, the maid is very cunning;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      She is safe at home, and sends you mockery."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The gallant ceased his tune, and swore in bitter anger,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "If again that maid I meet by any hap,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Either in the highroad, or on the flowery meadow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">

      <br />

    <p>
      Then the love songs of Poitou have a light and humorous turn, a jest at
      the fickleness of the runaway lover, and the easy consolation of the young
      maiden, whose desire is more to have a lover than that he should be any
      particular person. La Belle Rosalie illustrates this gay mockery of
      youthful love.

      There is also a flavor of mockery in the naïve dialogue between the

      shepherdess wants to be assured of something more substantial than mere
      affection before she yields to the temptation.

      In Le Berger qui me fait le Cour, the shepherdess displays more grace and
      sentiment in refusing to point out the identity of her lover, while
      avowing her charming and spontaneous affection.

      The maiden surprised by her lover as she lies asleep beneath the shade is
      a favorite subject in all folk-poetry, but it is seldom that it has been
      treated with a greater grace and charm than in La Belle Endormie. The
      sentiment has all the simplicity and purity of spontaneous love, and the
      language the sweet naïveté of folk-song, however much of its charm may
      have vanished in the translation.

      THE FAIR ONE ASLEEP.
    </h2>
    <p class="indent5">
      In walking in the garden,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To shun the burning light,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I saw beneath the leafage
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      A maid of beauty bright.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With noiseless feet I crept
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To where the damsel slept.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With noiseless feet I tip-toed
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To give her no alarm,

    <p class="indent5">
      Her head had for a pillow

    <p class="indent10">
      Her round and rosy arm,

      As softly as the air

    <p class="indent5">
      I kissed her dreaming there.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And while she lay in slumber,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I sought a garden bed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And on her snowy bosom
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I placed a rosebud red.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The flower's breath of balm
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Dispelled her slumber's charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When slumber's charm had vanished,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      She woke with laughing eyes;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Oh, magic love, how charming
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To catch hearts by surprise!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To wake them like the dawn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When spring-time is new-born.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the bosquet of Pouzange
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I meet my faithful loves.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They murmur in the leafage,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sweet tender-throated doves.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They sing the whole day long,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And love is all their song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a sadder note which makes itself heard in these songs of love
      in Poitou, as elsewhere,&mdash;the lamentation of the maiden who has
      listened too fondly to the words of her shepherd lover, and experienced
      his faithlessness. She must hide at home with her shame, and sadly find
      that only her dog is faithful.

      While I shamefaced must hide at home,

    <p class="indent10">
      Vainly asking when my love will come,

      The conscription, which compels the peasant, who has drawn the fatal
      number, to leave his native fields and his mistress, is an important and
      disturbing influence in the rural life of France, and finds a frequent
      place in its folk-song. Sometimes it is taken gayly, and the lover departs
      in high spirits, singing along the road to the garrison with his
      companions, and promising fidelity to his mistress to whom he hopes soon
      to return. It is thus in the gay song Voici l'Hiver Passé.

      But the circumstances are not always so cheerful nor the songs so gay.
      There is a tragedy, when, moved by an irresistible longing, the
      unfortunate conscript has deserted the ranks, been captured by his
      comrades, and condemned to suffer the penalty of his weakness in a
      shameful death. The old songs have many subjects of that kind, whose
      memory lingers, although the penalty for desertion is now less severe. One
      of them is Le Deserteur, whose deeply plaintive air, and the melopoeism of
      its verse, as well as its simple tragedy, have kept it alive.

      But the soldier or the sailor after long years of service gets leave to
      return to his home on a furlough or a discharge. Sometimes he is welcomed
      by his aged parents or his faithful wife, who recognize him with joyful
      surprise, in spite of his rags and wounds; and sometimes he finds that his
      long absence has wrought fatal changes, that his parents are dead, or his
      wife, deceived by false news of his death, has married again. Incidents of
      this latter kind are familiar in folk-song, but there is none where the
      story is more simply and dramatically told, or where the conduct of the
      unfortunate husband shows such pathetic refinement of feeling, than in La
      Femme du Marin, which is one of the best-known and popular of the old
      songs of Poitou. The air is charmingly soft and melancholy, and the words
      display a skill in melody which the most accomplished poet might envy. A
      more felicitous verse can hardly be found in the whole annals of folk-song
      than this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Quand le marin revient de guerre,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tout doux.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Quand le marin revient de guerre,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tout doux.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Tout mal chaussé, tout mal vetu,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Pauvre marin du reviens tu?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tout doux.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly necessary to apologize for the imperfection of an attempt to
      render such a flower of poetry into another language.

      SOME ANCIENT PORTUGUESE BALLADS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he larger and more
      important literature of Spain has naturally drawn a wider attention than
      that of its smaller neighbor in the Iberian peninsula. The great
      achievements of Spanish genius in the era of its intellectual
      efflorescence have compelled the intellectual world to study its language
      and familiarize itself with its literature. And not only have the great
      works of Cervantes and Calderon and Lope de Yega been studied and
      criticised, and reproduced in all the cultivated languages of Europe, but
      the treasures of popular Spanish poetry, with their rich elements of
      chivalry and romantic passion, have been carefully studied and exemplified
      by foreign scholars, and been the inspiration of foreign poets and
      translators. Hardly any country in Europe has a more valuable collection
      of popular poetry in the times of its military and intellectual greatness,
      or which more thoroughly illustrates its history or the characteristics of
      its national temperament. The long chronicles of the Cid, and the ballad
      narratives of the exploits of the heroes of the great struggles for the
      expulsion of the Moors, form in themselves a rich body of national poetry,
      but they are supplemented by an immense number of episodical ballads
      relating to events in national history, and lyrical poems and songs
      expressing the strong feeling and intellectual energy of the people. Many
      scholars and poets of eminence in European countries have devoted
      themselves to the reproduction of these Spanish national poems in their
      own languages, and in England during the early part of the present century
      there was a strong bent of scholarship in that direction, induced to a
      considerable extent, probably, by the national interest in the Peninsular
      war. Southey, Scott, and John Hookham Frere gave admirable translations of
      Spanish national poems, and the spirited versions of ancient Spanish
      ballads by Lockhart have been justly considered a permanent addition to
      English poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no such degree of attention has been paid to Portuguese literature,
      although it possesses the same national characteristics as the Spanish,
      and is not inferior, except in volume, as regards the product of popular
      poetry and folk-song. This was natural enough. Except the great poem of
      Camoens, Portuguese literature possesses no masterpiece to compel the
      attention of the civilized world, and the product of its national genius
      is not of the bulk and importance of that of Spain. Its national
      characteristics were similar, so that independent study was not incited by
      original features, while the difference in language was sufficient to be a
      barrier to all except special scholars. The country was in a measure
      overwhelmed and overshadowed by Spain, although possessing independent and
      interesting features of its own, and has been regarded as a province
      rather than as an original country. Very little attention has been paid in
      foreign countries to Portuguese popular literature, although some French
      and German scholars have included it in their studies, and there is no
      volume in English, so far as I am aware, which deals with it. At the same
      time it is well worth attention in its richness and value in all the
      qualities which make a high order of popular poetry, and in those elements
      of chivalric feeling, dramatic incident, and intensity of passion which
      characterize Spanish poetry of the same period. Fortunately Portugal
      itself has shared in that interest, which has spread through all the
      civilized countries of Europe in ancient popular literature and folk-song,
      and its national scholars have devoted a painstaking care and interest to
      collecting and elucidating its ancient ballads. The pioneer in this work
      was Almeida Garrett, himself a distinguished poet, who, being compelled to
      take refuge in England by the political disturbances of 1820, came under
      the influence of Sir Walter Scott as regards the work which he had done
      for the national literature of Scotland. Like Scott he at first wrote
      imitations of the old ballads with their literary style and phrases.
      These, like all other imitations of ancient ballads, although full of
      strength and poetical power, had not the genuine naturalness of antiquity
      and the inimitable flavor of primitive art. Later, on his return to
      Portugal, Almeida Garrett set himself to work to collect the ancient
      Portuguese ballads, as Scott had done those of the Scottish border, and
      was almost equally successful. The backwardness of the Portuguese
      peasantry in education, and their comparative seclusion from the
      influences of modern civilization in their mountains and valleys,
      contributed very much to the preservation of their ancient ballads, and
      even to-day they are a part of the oral literature of the country. There
      were of course many ancient ballads, in written and printed forms, which
      were preserved in libraries and in the papers of old families, but the
      great bulk of Almeida Garrett's collection was derived from oral
      tradition. He followed the example of Scott in uniting the best forms of
      varying versions into a complete and harmonious whole, and it is hardly
      doubtful that he also supplied an occasional wanting or imperfect line.
      But his general faithfulness and respect for the originals have been
      abundantly proved by the work of later collectors. The popular poetry of
      Portugal owes no less to Almeida Garrett than that of Scotland does to
      Scott, and he inculcated a pride in national history and national
      literature by his genius, as well as rescued the remains of ancient
      popular poetry by his painstaking care. Since his time he has been
      followed by other Portuguese scholars, who have worked under the
      restrictions of more absolute faithfulness and historic research imposed
      by the modern study of folk-lore. Notably Signor Braga has published two
      very valuable volumes, Komanceiro Geral, relating to the popular poetry of
      Portugal, and the Cantos Populares do Archipelago Açoriario, the songs of
      the Azore islands, whose seclusion from the world has been very favorable
      to the preservation of the ancient popular poetry and folk-lore. There are
      others who have made national collections, and the folk-songs of the
      various provinces, so that now the popular poetry of Portugal has been as
      carefully gathered and preserved as that of any other nation of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular poetry of Portugal had its period of efflorescence
      contemporaneous with that of Spain, and covered the period of its national
      energy and enterprise. The oldest specimens now extant are not considered
      to date beyond the fifteenth century, although, of course, they may have
      derived their origin from still more ancient ballads. The greater part is
      included within the two centuries following, when the national mind still
      preserved the spring and energy which had accomplished such great
      achievements in navigation and enterprise, and before its spirit had been
      crushed into the narrow bounds of a restricted and decaying province.
      Contrary, however, to the condition of the national poetry in Spain, the
      allusions to the actual events of recorded history are somewhat rare, and,
      although the actions of kings and national heroes make some figure, for
      the most part they relate to popular traditions, which have but a vague
      connection with national history. In style and manner, however, they bear
      a close resemblance to the Spanish popular poems, and in many instances
      they appear but as slightly differing variants, although it is doubtful
      which may have been the original, the Spanish or the Portuguese. The
      ballad of Dom Yanno, which is a specimen of the longer popular romances,
      is similar, except in its termination, to the Castilian romance known
      under the title of the Count Alarcos, and which has been translated by
      Lockhart under the title of Count Alarcos and the Infanta Solisa. In the
      Spanish romance the count actually fulfills the commands of the king by
      murdering his spouse, but before her death she cites the king and the
      infanta to appear within thirty days before the judgment seat of God, and
      it is accomplished by their deaths in that time. There are numerous
      variants to the ballad in Spanish popular literature, and it has been made
      the subject of dramas by Lope de Vega and others. Its connection with
      actual history is unknown.

      The ballad of The Ship Catharine is one of the best known and most popular
      among the folk-songs of Portugal. Various attempts have been made by
      Almeida Garrett, Braga, and others to attach it to some historical event,
      but without satisfactory success, and, indeed, its character is such that
      it is apparent that it belongs rather to the order of indefinite romance.
      The incidents in regard to the drawing of the lots to see who shall be
      eaten, and the ascent of the sailor to look for land, are to be found in
      the folk-songs of various maritime nations. One of them has been found in
      Brittany and has been preserved by M. Luzel in the Gwerzion Breiz-Izel. It
      relates that a vessel, which had been voyaging for twenty-seven years upon
      the high seas, naturally fell short of provisions, and the crew were
      compelled to think of eating each other:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when they had drawn for the short straw, it was the master of the
      vessel to whom it fell&mdash;Great God, is it possible that my sailors
      will eat me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little page, little page, you who are quick and nimble&mdash;go to the
      top of the main mast to find out where we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he mounted singing, and descended weeping&mdash;I have been to the
      top of the main mast and have not seen any land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go again to the top of the main mast to find out where we are&mdash;It
      will be for the last time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He mounted weeping, and he descended singing &mdash;I believe that we are
      restored to land&mdash;I have seen the tower of Babylon," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ballad, The Little Midshipman, in the popular songs of Provence, is very
      similar in incident and language to The Ship Catharine, with a change in
      the localities, the midshipman seeing Toulon and Marseilles instead of the
      coasts of Portugal and Spain. In later French folk-song the ballad has
      become a burlesque after the fashion of Malbrook, and is known as Il était
      un Petit Navire. This in its turn was developed in the after-dinner song
      of Thackeray, "There were three sailors of Bristol city," and is an
      instance of the persistence of folk-song, even though changed in form and
      purpose. The supernatural element in The Ship Catharine is rare in
      Portuguese popular poetry.

      It is somewhat singular that with all the enterprise of the Portuguese
      upon the sea during their period of national glory, their perilous and
      adventurous navigations, and their many successful engagements in marine
      warfare, there should be so few ballads relating to the sea-faring
      exploits. There is one, however, Don Juan d'Armada, which seems to relate
      to some definite victory over the Turks, but the occasion and even the
      name of the hero are not recorded in authentic history. It has many
      features, however, which would indicate that it was the account of an
      actual event.

      As in the Spanish romances, there are numerous allusions in the Portuguese
      ballads to the constant warfare waged with the Barbary corsairs, and the
      adventures of the unhappy captives who fell into their hands and were
      reduced to cruel servitude. A favorite theme with the ballad-writers was
      the rescue of the captive through the means of the Moorish damsel, who had
      fallen in love with him as she saw him laboring at his tasks. No doubt
      some such adventures actually happened, and at any rate the theme was one
      which appealed strongly to the imagination of the popular poets. This one
      ends with a touch of sentiment which might seem a modern addition, if the
      authenticity of the whole ballad was not vouched for by so careful a
      collector as Braga.

      The Faithful Paladin has a more tragical ending for the captive. The
      ballad had its origin in the province of Algarve, but there are several
      variants in Portuguese as well as similar ballads in Spanish. Calderon has
      made the theme the subject of a drama under the title of The Constant
      Prince, relating to the captivity and sufferings of Don Fernando, heir to
      the throne of Portugal, who was captured by the Moors in 1438,

      The epoch of the Crusades is beyond the limit of the popular ballads which
      have been preserved, although it is probable that they may have had their
      foundation in originals of that date. The story of the return of the
      spouse from the Holy Land, and his making himself known after various
      trials of his wife's fidelity, is a common one in the ballads of all
      European nations, and is of a character to appeal to the dramatic
      instincts of the popular poets. Close resemblances to the ballad of The
      Fair Princess can be found in German, French, and Spanish popular poetry,
      and the theme itself of course dates back to the return of Ulysses, and to
      the ballads which were the origin of the Odyssey.

      The ballad of Dom Duardos and Flerida has an antique flavor in its
      simplicity and indefiniteness, as in its element of imaginative poetry,
      which would lead to a belief in its ancient origin, dating beyond the
      acquirement of more accomplished art in the popular poets. A similar
      ballad is to be found in the Castilian.

      Ballads on the subject of the slaying a would-be ravisher with his own
      arms are common in popular poetry, and striking examples are found in
      Scotch, French, and Spanish. There are several variants in Portuguese of
      The Pilgrim Maid, but the best is that furnished by Almeida Garrett.

      The Portuguese ballads, which relate to domestic tragedies, without
      reference to historic events, are numerous, and very frequently of a high
      order of merit. They have the characteristics of folkpoetry in their
      dramatic interjections and irregularities, but often have a consistency
      and strength not found in the more romantic ballads. The Death-Bed
      Marriage is a specimen of this class.

      From the frontier of Castille the bitter news has flown,

      The brave Dom Juan is dying; how his dear love will moan;

      The youngest two declared that the malady was slight;

    <p class="indent5">
      But when the elder entered he saw with clearer light.

    <p class="indent5">
      To the dying man he said, "You've but three hours to live,

      While these sad words gave warning, fair Isabel stood by.

      The ballad of Dom Aleixio, of which there are several versions, has a
      lightness of touch in the description of the masquerading maid, which is
      not often found in the popular ballads, although the conclusion is
      sufficiently tragic.

      The ballad of Dom Pedro Menino was found by Signor Braga in the Azores
      islands, and is by him attributed to an actual historical event, the
      marriage of Dom Pedro Nino, a simple knight, to the infanta Beatrixe of
      Portugal; but, notwithstanding the similarity of names, it must be
      considered as at least doubtful.

    <p class="indent10">
      Each one was handsome, brave and tall;

    <p class="indent5">
      The king commanded them to come,

    <p class="indent5">
      The first put on the royal robe;

      The next the ribboned shoe-strings tied;

      The third and youngest of the three

      His prentice hand as barber tried.

      The princess saw his blooming face,

    <p class="indent10">
      And smiled on him with loving eye;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The King was told the shameful thing,

      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He cast him in a dungeon cell,

      Within a tower great and strong.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While waiting there the fatal day,

    <p class="indent10">
      A huntsman chanced to pass along.

    <p class="indent10">
      "Cousin, what do you there?" said he.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The prisoner answered through the grate,

    <p class="indent10">
      "I'm destined for the gallows tree.

      That to the princess I had said."

    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent5">
      The huntsman to the marquise goes,

      As sure as comes to-morrow's morn."
    </p>
    <p>

      The marquise mounted a fleet steed,

      Their mantles hung upon their arms,

      They had not time their cloaks to don.

      The ballad of Count Nillo may perhaps be attributed to the same real or
      imaginary origin as the preceding on account of some similarity in the
      name and the language, although the denouement is different. The trees
      which spring from the tombs of the unfortunate lovers and unite their
      branches is one of the most familiar images in folk-poetry, and hardly any
      collection of national ballads is without an example.

    <h2>
      HUNGARIAN FOLK-SONGS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is a
      Hungarian proverb which says, "The Magyar amuses himself by weeping."
      There is an underlying element of melancholy in this proud and
      high-spirited race, and its susceptibility to sadness is manifest in its
      folk-poetry as in its remarkable and powerful national music, which has
      for the fine ear a note of lamentation beneath its fiery tone. This is not
      singular, for the folk-songs of almost every nation have this pervading
      element to a greater or less degree, characterized by shades of
      temperament and national and historical influences, and showing that the
      minds of primitive peoples were most deeply affected by the woes of life
      rather than its joys, and the disappointments rather than the successes of
      passion, which express themselves in poetry. The aspects of nature,
      particularly the loneliness of vast plains such as exist in Hungary, and
      the enforced pensiveness of the shepherd life, exercise a powerful
      influence in giving a melancholy tinge to popular poetry, and in its
      melody and in its thought it breathes the note of the rain-laden breeze
      that sighs across the vast expanse, and the lights of whose magic sunshine
      are rather of sadness than exhilaration. Like all primitive poetry, born
      in times of strife and a disorganized and turbulent condition of society,
      the Magyar ballads deal with violent passions and bloodshed, and the
      brigands, who were rather military outlaws than common robbers, are the
      popular heroes, and appeal to the peasant imagination as the embodiments
      of the revolt of the people against the tyranny of the rich and powerful.
      But, in spite of their exploits, the gallows always waits for them, and
      the ballads end with the dismal spectacle of the body swinging in the wind
      on the deadly tree, while in the midst of their carousings the note of
      sadness and the foreboding of certain fate constantly intrudes. The Magyar
      brigand ballads have a much deeper element of poetry and passion than is
      to be found in the coarse humor and vulgar trickery of the English Robin
      Hood ballads, and express a finer and more delicate fibre of national
      feeling. The prevalent characteristics of Magyar folk-poetry are, however,
      the same as those of the higher standard of popular ballads, and were
      produced by similar influences, and in similar condition of mind. There is
      the same vigor of expression and strength of natural imagery, the same
      abruptness and disconnection in the construction in which dramatic
      dialogue is interjected into description with a perfect faith in the
      hearer's comprehension, the same naïveté and freshness of language, and
      the same simplicity and passion of thought. Those striking coincidences in
      subject and form of expression which are noted, to the wonder and
      bewilderment of the students of folk-poetry and folk-tales, in the most
      widely diverse nations, and which would almost lead to the belief in a
      common origin and derivation, or to some means of intercommunication yet
      unknown, are to be found in the Magyar ballads, connecting them with the
      common stock. In the specimens which follow, the ballad of Poisoned Janos
      is almost exactly similar in construction and refrain to the Scotch ballad
      of Lord Randal:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "O, where hae ye been, Lord Randal, my son,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      O, where hae ye been, my handsome young man?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I hae been to the wild-wood; mother, make my bed soon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For I'm wearie wi hunting, and fain wald lie down!"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      with the substitution of the "crab with four feet" for the "eels boiled in
      broo"&mdash;the conventional poisoned dish. The same ballad in substance
      and form of expression, with the same devising of property to friends and
      the same bestowal of a curse upon the murderess, is to be found in Danish,
      German, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, Italian, and other European folk-poetry,
      and may yet be discovered in Africa and the South Seas. The circumstance
      of the infant speaking from the cradle, giving warning of the
      faithlessness of his mother in Barcsai is common in the folk-ballads of
      many nations, and the incident of a bird's singing ill-news, the request
      of a dead man for a peculiar kind of coffin and a favorite burial place,
      and the growing together of flowers from the graves of a loving couple,
      are almost universal features in popular poetry; and the rejection of the
      body of a murdered man by a stream is also familiar. The griefs and
      sorrows over mortality, the laments of disappointed love, the woes of
      lonely old age, the remorse for sin, and the fierce passions of jealousy
      and revenge are common to human nature, and are interpreted in the same
      language the world over, whether in civilization or barbarism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the versions which follow, it is needless to state the
      difficulty of transferring the original vividness of expression, or
      preserving the effect of the repetitions and other peculiarities of
      primitive poetry in the conventional fetters of modern verse and rhyme.
      The first ballad, Barcsai, is given in a literal translation in order that
      these forms and turns of expression may be appreciated. The others have
      been rendered as literally and with as much of the original flavor as
      possible, but with a consciousness that much of the latter has inevitably
      evaporated. As says M. Jean de Nathy, to whose literal translations into
      French, Ballades et Chansons Populaires de la Hongrie, I am indebted for
      my knowledge of Magyar folkpoetry: "For the greater part without rhymes,
      they abound in repetition of words and parts of phrases, in alliterations
      and parallelism, called by the poet Arany 'rhymes of thought' which are
      difficult to render in modern forms of verse."

    <h2>
      FOLK-SONGS OF ROUMANIA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t gives one a
      strange idea of what treasures of primitive poetry and music may yet be
      found among the peasantry of Europe, when a volume like this&mdash;The
      Bard of the Dimbovitza, Roumanian Folk-Songs. Collected from the Peasants
      by Helene Yacaresco. Translated by Carmen Sylva and Alma Strettell&mdash;has
      been brought to light from the single district of Roumania. The preface by
      Carmen Sylva (the Queen of Roumania), herself an accomplished literary
      artist, says that these songs were collected from the lips of peasant
      girls, the lute players, the reapers, and the gypsies, by the young
      poetess Helene Yacaresco, in the district of Roumania, in which her
      father's domain is situated. She spent four years in collecting them, and
      even although her family has been known and honored for centuries by the
      people, she encountered many difficulties in endeavoring to induce the
      peasants to repeat their songs to her. "She was forced to affect a desire
      to learn spinning that she might join the girls at their spinning parties,
      and so overhear their songs more easily; she hid in the tall maize to hear
      the reapers crooning; she caught them from the lips of peasant women, of
      lute players Cobzars,' so called from the name of their instrument, the
      cobza, or lute, of gypsies, of fortune tellers; she listened for them by
      death-beds, by cradles, at the dance, and in the tavern with inexhaustible
      patience." The result is a volume which is not only equal in quality to
      that of the finest folk-song and poetry which any European nation
      possesses, and with a peculiar and original flavor of its own, revealing
      strong and original national characteristics, but, one is tempted to say,
      with more of the sublimated and naked essence of poetry than can be found
      in any work of modern civilized poets. There are times when the vivid
      strength of simple passions, expressed with the force of naked directness
      without any weakening refinement of language, the feelings of a people to
      whom love is a genuine and undisguised passion, in whom hatred burns the
      blood and finds relief in the shot or the stab, to whom death is an object
      of vital horror as the end of life and happiness, and to whom religion is
      an embodiment of direct supernatural power, produce a poetry, which
      reaches a force of expression and touches the heart with a power to which
      all modern refinements of thought and language are unable to attain. It
      is, in comparison, as if a cloud of unreality, the emanations of
      artificial thoughts and sentiments, or the dust, as it were, of ages, had
      fallen upon the native freshness of feeling and language, and that
      civilized men were no longer able to feel so deeply or to speak so clearly
      as those who had never been burdened with knowledge, or the strength of
      whose emotions had not been diluted by the restraints and refinements of
      civilization, transcendental religion, or artificial society. There is, of
      course, a power and subtlety of thought in minds which have inherited the
      world's wisdom and knowledge, and their thoughts have a scope and extent
      to which those of unlettered peasants are strangers, and their views of
      the problems of life and humanity are as those of a man to a child; but
      the strength of their feeling in simple passion is much diluted and their
      powers of expression are correspondingly less, so far as vividness and
      simplicity are concerned. As an illustration of the weakness of purely
      artistic literature, whatever its beauty and skill, to touch the depths of
      feeling like the purely unsophisticated language of the natural poets, who
      simply endeavored to express their emotions without thought of form or
      artistic melody, may be compared the closing aspiration of the famous and
      beautiful serenade in Maud,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She is coining, my own, my sweet;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">

      Were it earth in an earthy bed;

    <p class="indent10">
      Had I lain for a century dead;

    <p class="indent10">
      And blossom in purple and red,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      with the simple utterance of the Javanese lover in one of the natural
      flowers of folk-song,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I do not know when I shall die,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I have seen at Badoer many that were dead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      They were dressed in white shrouds, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Were buried in the earth;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      If I die at Badoer and am buried beyond the

    <p class="indent5">
      Village eastward against the hill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Where the grass is high,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then will Adinda pass by there, and the border
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I shall hear it.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There are times when the vitality of poetry seems to be lost as one feels
      the simple and direct power of some of these ancient songs which spring
      from the heart and not from the head, and all modern verse seems like the
      pale and artificial product of intellectuality, weakened feeling, and
      language refined until it has lost its strength, and one is almost tempted
      to believe that civilization is as fatal to poetry as it is to religious
      enthusiasm. Of course this is not the case. The human heart has not lost
      its strength of feeling nor its power of expression, and modern poetry is
      greater in its power and wider in its scope than folk-song. But it has
      lost some of the peculiar strength which comes from simplicity of feeling
      and overmastering power of passion; and its language, if it has many
      delicate shades of meaning, which that of a primitive people has not, has
      lost the clearness and vividness of expression of those whose words are
      few, but which are the creation of their hearts and not of their
      intellects.
    </p>
    <p>
      These folk-songs of Roumania are full of the pathos and strength of simple
      passions, and they show a native poetical spirit and power of the
      imagination which is rare in any nation. Doubtless many of them are old,
      the inheritance of long tradition and familiar forms of expression, but it
      is indicated that many of them are new, and that the stock is being
      constantly added to by the force of a poetic inspiration, which is still
      in full life and flower. We are told that many of the spinning songs are
      improvisations, the girls all standing in a circle, the best spinner or
      singer in the centre, and that she begins to improvise a song, which is
      passed on for continuance with the distaff to any one whom she may select.
      Doubtless these are on familiar themes and with familiar forms of
      expression, like all folk-songs, but they show the vital spirit of poetry
      still existing, and the bulk of more elaborate compositions is probably
      still being added to. This fact confirms the belief, which intelligent
      observers have noted, that the Roumanians and the kindred peoples of this
      race have an intellectual power which is of an undecayed and still
      progressive people, very different from the effete Ottomans by whom they
      were so long oppressed, and that, if the future promised an opportunity
      for original development, instead of absorption into the Muscovite empire,
      they might produce a homogeneous and progressive nation with original
      features and an independent contribution to civilization. At any rate the
      volume gives evidence of remarkable intellectual power among the Roumanian
      peasantry, and it may be hoped that this treasure-trove will stimulate
      other researches, and the discovery of a larger bulk of native poetry, if
      none of finer value. Whether any touch of sentiment has been added in the
      translations with the higher poetic form in some instances cannot, of
      course, be apparent, but the internal evidence would indicate that
      essential faithfulness has been preserved and that the substance is as
      genuine as the poetry is original and powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the most striking songs in the collection are those of the
      gypsies, which have a wild and fiery tone like the gypsy music which has
      stirred the blood of refined civilization, as it has been performed by
      orchestras with all the effect of modern instrumentation, in a way that
      the most skillful composers have failed to do, and shows the element of
      poetry and passion in that strange and exotic race. What stronger beauty
      of expression or grace of feeling can be found than this?&mdash;

      A peculiar character in the Roumanian songs is that of the Heiduck, a sort
      of combination, it would seem, of the knight-errant and the brigand, with
      all the legendary attributes of beauty, strength, courage, and generosity
      of the half-fabulous popular heroes of all nations. The Song of the
      Heiduck has all the buoyant spirit and gayety appropriate to such a
      figure, but is overshadowed also by a sort of elfin sadness and the doom
      of a supernatural fate, which is chiefly to be found in those nations
      which have a tinge of oriental mysticism, and is a marked feature of the
      Roumanian folk-songs. The Celtic mysticism, where it exists, is more
      strictly religious.

      THE HEIDUCK'S SONG.
    </h2>
    <p class="indent5">
      <i>I tell the forest the wonders I see in my dreams </i>
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the forest loves to hear the tale of my dreaming
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      More than the song of birds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      More than the murmur of leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The huts had well-nigh beguiled me to stay, for the windows
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Stood wide, and the smiles of the maidens shone out from
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      within,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But the Heiduck am I&mdash;and I love the far-stretching roads
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the plain, and my galloping steed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My mother gave birth to me, sure, on a sunshiny morning,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And had I but never known love, ah, how happy were I!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I sing at the hour when the moon climbs above the horizon;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The tales that the aged folk know, I can tell, every one,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And I make the young dance, when I sing, to the tune of
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my
      ballads.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For I a strange woman have loved;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She comes every night to me now, and she kisses my forehead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And asks if I love her still.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      She carries a knife in her girdle&mdash;her eyes have a glitter
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Like daggers&mdash;her hand is as white as the veil of a bride;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But her voice I have never heard&mdash;yet know I full surely,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She asks if I love her still.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In token thereof I have given her up my girdle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      My cap with its feathers gay,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My mantle with broid'ry brave, and my glitt'ring daggers.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And my songs, I have given them all to her, one by one,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Yet the gayest bring no smile to her face, and the saddest
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Are powerless to make her sad.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then hence she goes, by the small plank over the river
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The plank that sways to her step.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The willows bow down their heads, and bend as she passes...
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And morning cometh, and findeth me poor and trembling,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Since she hath taken my all from me, even my songs.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Yet is she not content, nor will cease from asking,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whether I love her still.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      <i>I tell the forest the wonders I see in my dreams </i>
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the forest loves to hear the tale of my dreaming,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      More than the song of birds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      More than the murmur of leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all the songs have the refrain, as in this example, which is not,
      necessarily, directly associated with the subject of the song, but is
      suggested by some incident, circumstance, or scene brought to the mind at
      the time of the recital. As often in the old Scotch ballads, it adds a
      weird and touching effect like a dominant note in music, or a symbolical
      background to a picture.

      A marked feature in these folk-songs of Roumania, as in those of all other
      nations, is the place which fighting has in them, the songs of the
      soldiers who are going to battle for their native land, and the emotions
      of heroism, courage, and self-devotion; but as in all these songs there is
      an underlying element of melancholy, mysticism, and refined and delicate
      feeling, quite different from the savage ferocity, heartiness, and humor
      of more northern nations, and there is no trace whatever of the farcical
      rudeness and cunning which is attached to some of the heroes of the
      Scandinavian ballads. The sentiments expressed are those of singular
      refinement for a primitive people, and the general tone of the soldier
      songs is one of sadness and content in death, rather than of the fierce
      joy and hope of the conflict, as in the following characteristic specimen:&mdash;

      On the field of battle they dug his grave,

    <p class="indent15">
      And were glad they blossomed there.

    <p class="indent10">
      And when the wind in the treetops roared,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The soldier asked from the deep, dark grave,

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did
      the banner flutter then?"

    <p class="indent10">
      "The fight is done, but the banner won,

    <p class="indent10">
      Thy comrades of old have borne it hence,

    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And again he heard the shepherds pass,

    <p class="indent15">
      And the flocks go wand'ring by,

      And the soldier asked, "Is the sound I hear,

    <p class="indent15">
      The sound of the battle's roar?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And they all replied: "My hero, nay!

    <p class="indent10">
      Thou art dead, and the fight is o'er,

    <p class="indent10">
      Our country joyful and free."

      "Are these not the voices of them that love,

      "We are those that remember not;

      As has been said, the underlying and predominant element of these
      Roumanian folk-songs is melancholy, and rarely, if ever, in those of any
      nation, is the sorrow of death and parting more vividly and powerfully
      expressed. The voices speak from beyond the grave, but they seem to
      intensify rather than lighten the grief, and the calm and beauty of nature
      bring no consolation to the stricken heart, but only deepen the agony.
      This dirge for a child will speak to every one who has known anguish, as
      with the voice of the wailing wind:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The river went weeping, weeping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ah, me, how it did weep!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But I would never heed it,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The weeping of the river,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whilst thou were at my breast.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The stars&mdash;poor stars&mdash;were weeping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But I would not hear their weeping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whilst yet I heard thy voice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Unhappy men drew nigh, and told me of their woe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They said: "We are the sorrow of all humanity."
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But I had no compassion for human misery,.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whilst thou wert with me still.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then these, the river with its weeping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The piteous stars, the miserable men,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      All prayed the earth's dark depths to take thee from me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That so my woe might understand their woe;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And now&mdash;I weep.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Yet weep I not for human misery,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      N<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or
      for the stars' complaining,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Nor for the river's wailing.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I weep for thee alone, most miserly,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Keep all my tears for thee!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Now I must rock forever empty arms,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That grieve they have no burden any more.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Now I must sing, and know, the while, no ears
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Are there to hearken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The birds will ask me, "To whom singest thou?"

    <p class="indent10">
      That I did give her thee.

    <p class="indent5">
      My womb upbraideth me because I gave

    <p class="indent5">
      To Death the gift that once she gave to me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The gift that sprung from her.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Now must I see thy sleep and never know

    <p class="indent10">
      Whether this sleep be sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then do I ask of Earth
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Is the sleep sweet indeed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That in thy lap we sleep?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But, ah! thou knowest Earth misliketh pity,

    <p class="indent15">
      And loves to hold her peace!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Wilt thou then answer in her stead, and say,

    <p class="indent15">
      "What do the birds, O mother,

    <p class="indent15">
      Since I have gone to sleep?

      Since I have gone to sleep?

      And thy broken heart, O mother,

      The river went weeping, weeping,

      Ah, me, how it did weep!

      The weeping of the river,

    <p class="indent5">
      And so we must wade through the river to-day.

    <p class="indent5">
      The maidens sing as they wade, and are gay.

      A little sister the dead child had,

    <p class="indent5">
      Since it died little sister has grown more glad,

      And saith to the mother: "Its own sweet smile

    <p class="indent5">
      The one that is dead unto me did give,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And all the life that it might not live

    <p class="indent5">
      Now lives in me." But the mother, the while
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Fell a-weeping, and bowed her head,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And remembered the child that was dead.

    <p class="indent5">
      <i>The river last night swept the bridge away, </i>

      There are other sources of grief than that of simple death, whose sorrow
      can weep itself away, the tragedies of crime and sin and the agonies of
      remorse. There is an occasional touch of that ferocity which rejoices in a
      bloody revenge, as would be natural to a passionate people, and which is
      manifested in the Song of the Dagger.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The dagger at my belt that dances
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whene'er I dance:
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But when I drink the foaming wine cup,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then it grows sad;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For it is thirsty, too, the dagger,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It thirsts for blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the most part the songs which relate to violence and bloodshed are
      the expressions of the remorse that follows the crime, and with a touch of
      the prevailing mysticism in the reproach of natural objects. The water
      refuses to quench the thirst of the murderer, and the trees to give him
      shelter, and he wanders on an endless way haunted by the voice of his
      crime. The poem entitled The Outcast expresses this feeling of mysterious
      remorse and unending and unavailing expiation.

      One of the peculiar customs of Roumania is that of two girls of different
      families choosing each other as sisters by affinity, called <i>suratas</i>,
      or "sisters of the cross," a relationship sanctioned by the church, and
      acting as the tie of blood in relation to family marriages. It is this
      custom which is alluded to in the charming ballad, which recalls the best
      of those of Spain on similar subjects, with its delicate feeling and
      graceful expressions:&mdash;

      The spinning songs, which are absolutely improvisations, have, of course,
      all the inevitable character of abruptness and irregularity, but a
      charming grace of feeling is often visible through them, and their imagery
      is as effective as it is spontaneous and natural.

      These specimens will give an idea of the charm, the grace, the pathos, and
      the melody of these Roumanian songs, which are like the breath of wild
      mountain air, full of the voices of the birds and streams, the wailings of
      the wind, and the sad plaints of the human heart. There is scarce a page
      in the not very voluminous collection which is not marked with some
      untaught grace of thought or language, and which has not the charm and
      power of simple and strong emotion. However literal they may be, and the
      impression is very strongly conveyed of their absolute faithfulness, they
      also owe much to the fine grace and skill and to the melody of the verse
      into which they have been rendered in a foreign language, and the lovers
      of poetry owe a grateful debt to Carmen Sylva and Miss Alma Strettell, who
      had been already favorably known for her translations of Greek folksongs
      for the artistic quality of their translations. No richer treasury of
      primitive poetry has been disclosed for many years.
